All Rights Reserved Ethics Statement - The Verge The Verge The Verge logo. The Verge homepage The Verge homepage The Verge The Verge logo. / Tech / Reviews / Science / Entertainment / More Menu Expand The Verge The Verge logo. Menu Expand Skip to main content Ethics Statement Since it launched in 2011, The Verge has operated under a strict ethics policy that ensures our editorial independence and the integrity of our journalism. All of our editorial staff are required to abide by the following guidelines, many of which exceed standards in our industry. Earning and keeping the trust of our audience is, and always will be, at the core of The Verge ’s mission. In a world where information is distributed across countless platforms and formats, it’s more important than ever to promote clear ethical guidelines that allow audiences to know where that information comes from and whether it can be trusted. As a part of Vox Media, The Verge also adheres to the Vox Media Editorial Ethics & Guidelines . Editorial independence Our most valuable asset is the independence that allows us to publish stories without fear. The Verge is routinely critical of people and companies we cover, and we’re most proud of our work when we tell stories that people in power would prefer not see the light of day. We are able to enjoy this independence because every member of our editorial team is required to follow a strict code of conduct. Additionally, we enforce a strict wall between The Verge ’s editorial team and our parent company’s advertising teams (addressed more in detail below). Here are the core guidelines in our code of conduct: We don’t accept things of value from companies or from their PR firms, period We do not accept preconditions for coverage of a story that require us to say certain things We do not give subjects of our reporting the ability to preview or approve interview questions, nor do we allow them to review our stories before we publish We do not allow reporters to cover people or companies where they have a personal conflict We do not make paid endorsements of any kind We do not personally invest in companies we cover Our editorial team does not produce paid content, ever Our policy against receiving anything of value from companies we cover includes, but is not limited to, things like gifts, meals, discounted services, or paid trips and junkets. Vox Media and The Verge pay for all travel expenses to all events, including transportation, food, and hotels. Professional conduct In addition to standards that preserve our independence, The Verge ’s reporters are expected to abide by industry-standard ethical guidelines for reporting. This means that our editorial team takes great care to learn the truth and report it, protect sources , minimize risk of harm, and strive for accuracy and honesty in everything we publish. We use the Society of Professional Journalists’ code of ethics as a baseline for the professional conduct of our editorial staff. Sourcing Standards at The Verge The Verge maintains high standards for sourcing. Our reporters will always carefully explain our sourcing practices to you and strive to protect your confidentiality when appropriate. If you are a communications professional, or talking to us in your official capacity, we will abide by the following definitions. ON THE RECORD “On the record” is the default for talking to reporters and editors at The Verge. You say things, we record them, we can report who you are and quote what you said. We will expect corporate communications professionals and people speaking to us in an official capacity to be on the record in almost every single case, and you will have to tell us why you want to change this default every single time. ON BACKGROUND “On background” means you can talk to us and we will not specifically identify you, instead using a descriptor like “company spokesperson.” If you are a corporate communications professional speaking to us in your official capacity , we will not in any circumstances attribute you as “a source familiar.” Going “on background” is an agreement between you and the reporters or editors you speak to at The Verge . The general rules of an agreement apply: you may offer to go on background, and we will accept or deny your request. If we do not specifically accept, there is no agreement. This means: You cannot email Verge reporters statements prefaced with “On background” and assume we will treat the material as if it is on background. You cannot tell us how a statement is to be attributed without asking. You cannot say things like “background not for attribution,” and we will not agree to that terminology. This is just off the record. Say what you mean. A reminder: you have to ask, and we have to agree. Every single time. OFF THE RECORD “Off the record” is simple: you talk to us, we agree not to use anything we hear in any of our reporting unless we can source it otherwise. Like background, off the record is an agreement. If we don’t agree, you are not off the record. We do not readily agree to off-the-record conversations with corporate communications professionals or people speaking in their official capacities without specific reasons. Advertising Vox Media employs a dedicated advertising team that is responsible for selling advertising space on our properties. Any feature on a Vox Media brand sponsored by a particular company or advertiser that is developed independently by the Vox Creative and Sales teams is clearly marked as ""Advertiser Content."" Advertisements do not necessarily reflect the views of Vox Media or our editorial teams. Vox Creative and Sales teams have their own set of guidelines and policies for developing content and do not infringe on the creative agency of editorial teams. Our editorial teams do not directly accept money or other consideration from individuals or entities as a condition or incentive to write a review or story, whether favorable or unfavorable. However, some of our editorial content is made possible through the support of sponsors. This content is clearly marked as content ""Presented"" by the applicable sponsor. Our sponsors may select which content they wish to support, however, we do not allow our Sales teams, Vox Creative, or our sponsors to control or interfere with the editorial integrity of our editorial teams and the content they create. Some of our content may contain marketing links, which means we will receive a commission for purchases made via those links. In our editorial content, these affiliate links appear automatically, and our editorial teams are not influenced by our affiliate partnerships. Vox Media does employ a commerce team to optimize certain content for affiliate revenue, and such content is marked as such by including a similar affiliate links disclosure. We work with several providers (currently Skimlinks and Rakuten Marketing) to manage our affiliate relationships. You can find out more about their services by visiting their sites. Distributed platforms The Verge is a multimedia brand that is distributed across many platforms, including our own site on the web, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and others. Our editorial standards apply to all of our platforms. Vox Creative does, on occasion, distribute sponsored editorial content and paid branded content through our distributed platforms. They are clearly labeled as ""Presented by"" (for editorial sponsorships) or ""Paid Content"" (for branded content) in the post and further labeled using platform-specific tools such as the Facebook handshake. Corrections and updates Despite making every effort to be accurate in our reporting, sometimes we get something wrong. If we discover a mistake in a story, our editors will promptly issue a correction that removes the inaccurate information and adds a notice of correction that explains the error. In some cases, like if an inaccuracy is contained in a video, we may have to remove the original piece of content and replace it with a version in which the error is omitted. Sometimes more information about a story we’ve published becomes available that either continues the narrative or clarifies the original story, but it is not a correction. In these cases, we may add and / or change elements of the original story. These updates will be clearly noted at the bottom of the story, indicating the time of the change and a note describing what was changed. Additionally, we may remove content if we believe it infringes on the intellectual property rights of a third party, otherwise violates any third-party rights, or breaches any applicable law or regulation. These decisions are made in concert with Vox Media’s legal team. Reviews Advising our audience about the best way to spend their time and money is one of our most important responsibilities. Our reviews always contain the honest, independent assessments of our editorial team. Like everything else we publish, there are no paid-for reviews of any kind written by The Verge editorial team. Companies may loan products (like laptops and smartphones) to our editors for a limited period of time so we can evaluate them and determine whether to review them. Occasionally, we will keep a review unit for an extended period of time to fully evaluate it and its software updates over time. We may also agree to an ""embargo"" with a company or PR firm that allows us to evaluate their product prior to its release. Personal investing We do not invest in companies we cover, and employees are forbidden from trading or buying stock in companies we cover or companies in the general technology sector. Vox Media’s retirement savings programs may hold some of these restricted stocks, but these funds are not managed directly by employees. Additionally, our employees are forbidden from owning or trading in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Other employment Employees of The Verge may not be otherwise employed by or receive compensation from companies that they are likely to cover, nor are they permitted to have any advisory role (paid or unpaid) at those companies. In general, writers and editors of The Verge are not allowed to conduct journalism for other publications without the express permission of the editor-in-chief. Giveaways From time to time, The Verge or Vox Media will conduct contests and giveaways for our audiences. We will post rules for each contest and giveaway, which will be binding to individuals who decide to participate. While giveaways or contests may be sponsored by an advertiser or partner, they are not and should never be considered endorsements of the entities involved or their products. Vox Media investors Vox Media has a number of investors, including, but not limited to, Accel Partners, Khosla Ventures, General Atlantic, Comcast Ventures, and NBCUniversal. A full list of our investors can be found here .

Menu Expand Entertainment / Gaming / Tech Hideo Kojima’s new Spotify podcast launches in September Hideo Kojima’s new Spotify podcast launches in September / And his best friend Geoff Keighley will be there, too! By Ash Parrish Aug 23, 2022, 8:47 PM UTC | Share this story Image: Spotify Have you ever wanted to know how in the hell a man like Hideo Kojima comes up with some of the outlandish stuff you see in his games? Well, you’re about to, as he’s coming soon to earholes near you. During Opening Night Live, otherwise known as Geoff Keighley’s European Adventure, the maestro of video game marketing announced that his friend, Hideo Kojima, would be making an appearance. And whenever Kojima deigns to show his face, the gaming world pauses with bated breath, waiting to see what bonkers-ass game that man has cooked up now. But unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on where in the Kojima fandom you fall), his newest announcement isn’t a new game or even a port of an old game but a podcast. Brain Structure , Kojima’s new podcast , launches exclusively on Spotify on September 8th. “In this podcast, we take a deep dive into his brain and shed light on his creative process,” reads the description on Spotify. “I look forward to having a good time getting and sharing creative inspiration with listeners from all over the world,” Kojima said in the announcement on Spotify’s blog. Kojima also mentioned that the audio will be in Japanese and English and that bestie Geoff Keighley will also make an appearance. Back in 2019, the last time Opening Night Live was held in person, Kojima showed up to show off new information about the then-forthcoming Death Stranding . His reappearance at the 2022 show teased that we might get a first glimpse at his next in-development game. But no — it’s a podcast, which isn’t bad, but good loving baby Jesus even the name, “Brain Structure,” oozes Kojima’s esoteric weirdness. And, as an exploration into Kojima’s mind, it’s bound to get even weirder. God love the man, truly. He sure does know how to make a moment. You can listen to the prologue now on Spotify, with new episodes launching weekly starting September 8th.

Menu Expand Entertainment / Gaming / Tech Is this a teaser for Hideo Kojima’s next game? Is this a teaser for Hideo Kojima’s next game? / ‘Who am I?’ By Jon Porter / @ JonPorty Sep 15, 2022, 12:23 PM UTC | Share this story “Who Am I?” Image: KojimaProductions.com Kojima Productions, the development studio led by Metal Gear Solid and Death Stranding director Hideo Kojima, has posted a cryptic teaser on its website that has fans speculating about what the company could be about to announce. The teaser , which data from the Wayback Machine suggests was posted this week, shows a dimly lit silhouette of a woman’s head with the words “who am I?” superimposed over it. Of course, Twitter has been quick to come up with some theories about who this could be. The most convincing is that it could be the actor Elle Fanning , perhaps best known for her role as Alice Dainard in Super 8 . But that’s just the first level of the fan theorizing. Taking things a step further is the fact that Fanning also appeared in a 2001 film called I Am Sam . And, of course, Death Stranding’s protagonist was Sam Porter Bridges. See? The dots basically connect themselves. It’s been three years since the release of Kojima’s last major title, Death Stranding , and expectations are high for what the director might be working on next. Death Stranding’s lead actor Norman Reedus let slip earlier this year that a sequel is currently in development . Kojima also made an appearance at an event in June to announce that his studio is partnering with Xbox on a “completely new game,” which is presumably separate from the Death Stranding sequel. Kojima himself doesn’t appear to have linked to the teaser via his personal Twitter account , which is free of any hints about what the image could relate to. Instead, the director has been busy tweeting about a recent video call with Get Out and Nope director Jordan Peele . His studio’s official Twitter account also recently put out a statement noting that it will not be showing off any new games at this year’s Tokyo Games Show, which runs from today to September 18th. (Instead, it plans to exhibit a VR experience based on the studio’s famous entryway .) Of course, there’s always the far less interesting possibility that the teaser relates to Kojima’s Spotify podcast , whose first episode was released on September 8th. The Hideo Kojima presents Brain Structure podcast promises to “take a deep dive into [Kojima’s] brain and shed light on his creative process.” A second episode is due to release today.

Menu Expand Skip to main content The Verge Community Guidelines Welcome to The Verge ! The Verge is all about exploring our dazzling, terrifying, exciting future together. We’re so glad you’re here and hope you’ll join our community of smart, talented, and enthusiastic people. We’ve created these community guidelines to help make sure that everyone feels welcome to participate on The Verge .  Whether participating in comments on our site, or out in the wild, like on YouTube, Facebook, or Instagram, we expect everyone in our community to follow these rules. First, let’s talk about what makes great comments. Be respectful. Being respectful in the commenting community is about more than just following the rules or being polite; it’s about trying to encourage good conversation by welcoming and including others. Think about how your words and actions might affect others. Better yet: think about how you can help make everyone want to jump in. Be curious. The Verge is about exploring our future together. Show up to the comments with the same spirit of curiosity we bring to writing posts for the site; it’s fun to learn, and we can help each other learn new and interesting things together. Remember that people come from all different places and backgrounds, so don’t assume you know what they think, feel, or mean. Be interesting. Another way of putting it: be relevant . Try to bring something new or unique to the conversation. This isn’t a race to be the first, the loudest, or the edgiest. We hope you’ll share cool stuff with the community, especially if that means sharing an insight that only you can provide. And remember to stay on topic; comments are not a free-for-all, and you’re more likely to write a great comment if it’s related to the topic at hand. Try to add value to each thread you participate in instead of just replying for the sake of it. Show your work. Approach commenting the same way The Verge approaches blogging. Making an argument? Back it up with something tangible that you can link to, whether it’s another news story, a scientific study, or a really good video explanation. Conversations and debates are usually richer and more interesting when people share the sources for their assumptions and conclusions. Help us out. Our moderators work hard every day to help make sure The Verge is a place where everyone feels welcome. You can help us by reporting comments that violate the rules, like spam, personal attacks, or creepy comments. (See the full rules below for an exhaustive list of Bad Things.) Put simply: don’t be a jerk to other people on The Verge. And if you see someone doing rude stuff in the comments, let us know. Rules We’re trying to foster great conversation and we will remove comments that hurt that goal. You’re free to say whatever you like at other places, but not here. At The Verge we have a different standard than the rest of the internet and we work hard to keep the conversation informative and fun. The bottom line is that the editors and moderators have the final say on whether comments fall within our community guidelines. We will remove anything we deem inappropriate, and these rules may evolve over time as needed. Doing any of the things listed here will result in your comment being removed, and serious violations will result in an instant ban. Personal attacks: Don’t attack or insult others. This includes calling other members trolls. Racism, sexism, and other discrimination: Attacking entire classes of people is just like attacking a single person: we’ll ban you for it. Commenting on someone’s physical appearance, voice, or style: Let’s keep discussion to the content, please. Even if you’re writing what you consider a compliment, it will be removed. Trolling: ”Trolling” is a big, messy term, but we know what trolls are and we won’t tolerate it. If you’re derailing conversations here at The Verge, we will take your comments and posts down, low-effort replies like “slow news day” and “tl;dr,” especially. Spreading misinformation: We are not a platform for spreading conspiracy theories and misinformation, and will remove posts promoting obvious falsehoods. Doxxing: Don’t reveal someone else’s personal information. Illegal activities: Posting links to illegal downloads, ways to steal service, and other nefarious activity is not OK here. NSFW material: Nope, not allowed. Even images or links that could be considered borderline are not acceptable. A good rule of thumb is that anything beyond PG-13 will get you in trouble, but we reserve the right to remove any post we deem offensive. This goes for pornographic material, vile language, gore and generally gross stuff. Complaining about coverage: We cover a wide array of topics, not all of which are comfortable, unchallenging, or reflective of your personal views. This applies doubly to review scores. While we’re not against discussions of our coverage, plainly stated accusations of bias or drive-by comments about a writer’s expertise are usually an indication that you’re not trying to be a productive member of the community. Spam: If it comes from a human or a robot, spam will be deleted. This includes self-promotion. Generally speaking, promoting your projects here will be treated like any other spam. Above all, our team of moderators works to keep conversation here friendly, engaging, helpful, and productive. If we feel a comment or forum post is harming that endeavor, we’ll take action.

Menu Expand Gadgets Matter 1.0 is finally finalized — so what’s next? The smart home standard is open for certification at last. We could see Matter devices in our homes as soon as this month. By Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / @ jp2e Oct 4, 2022, 4:00 PM UTC | Share this story Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge The Connectivity Standards Alliance has released the final Matter 1.0 standard and announced that the certification program is now open. An official Matter launch event is scheduled for November 3rd, but the first Matter devices could show up any day now. Companies can start selling Matter devices or upgrading existing ones as soon as they’re certified. When the idea of Matter was first floated in 2019 , there were a lot of people (myself included) who thought it would never happen. Apple, Google, Amazon, and Samsung sitting at a table together and coming up with a plan to fix the fractured smart home? Fierce competitors in the manufacturing space, such as lock makers Yale and Schlage and light makers Philips Hue and GE Lighting, developing a universal standard that would make their products work together in any ecosystem? It sounded like a pipe dream. And as the delays piled up , it sometimes felt like Matter would never arrive. The CSA has announced the official release of the Matter 1.0 specification. Image: CSA But today, Matter certification labs are up and running, the SDK is complete, and companies can start manufacturing, upgrading, and getting the official Matter stamp of approval for their devices. While the specification has only just been finalized, several companies were working on Matter-compatible products as part of an early access program, which means we could start to see Matter devices any day now. “We had a strong group of companies that participated in our testing process,” Michelle Mindala-Freeman of the CSA told The Verge . “These will be among the first products to be branded and available as Matter.” The Matter launch event scheduled for November 3rd will likely have some of these early products on show. The invitation indicates there will be a demo area where companies can showcase their Matter-certified products. The CSA is hosting a Matter launch event in November. Image: CSA A universal connectivity standard, Matter is designed to make smart home devices simpler .  By giving your door lock and light bulb a way to talk directly to each other, either over Wi-Fi or a newer protocol called Thread , Matter should make the smart home faster and more responsive. It should also enable an easier setup process, with compatible devices automatically showing up on your smartphone to allow you to connect them. Plus, with a common language that’s local to your home and doesn’t rely on the cloud, your devices can be controlled by more than one smart home ecosystem or voice assistant . This isn’t a quick fix, however, as the initial Matter spec only covers a limited number of device categories . The CSA has said it is developing specifications for more devices — including popular categories such as security cameras and robot vacuums. But at launch, the compatible devices will be limited to smart light bulbs and fixtures, smart plugs and switches, smart thermostats and other HVAC controls, smart shades, smart sensors, connected locks, and media devices including TVs. Google announced that all its Nest smart speakers and displays will be upgraded to be Matter controllers. Some, including the Nest Hub Max, Nest Hub (2nd gen), and its Nest Wifi routers will also be Thread border routers. Image: Google The first rollout also includes Matter controllers and bridges, which are devices such as the Google Nest Hub Max and Amazon Echo smart speaker that can act as both a conduit for devices to talk to each other and as an interface for you to control your devices using voice or a touchscreen interface. Smartphone apps such as the Google Home app and the Apple Home app will also be Matter controllers. Bridges can also be Matter certified to bring their connected products into the Matter ecosystem. For example, Signify, owner of Philips Hue, has said its smart lighting control bridge will be upgraded to Matter , allowing its lights to be controlled by any Matter controller without the lights being updated. Amazon’s fourth-gen Echo speaker will be a Thread border router, and the company has said most of its existing smart speakers and displays will be upgraded to Matter controllers. Image: Amazon The CSA also says Matter is designed to be secure using technology that ensures devices have to confirm who they are and where they are from before being allowed on the network. In terms of privacy, Matter operates entirely locally over IP, but it doesn't rely on an internet connection to run. However, it is designed to talk to the cloud easily. Those conversations are controlled by the ecosystem app or device app you use and, in turn, governed by their individual privacy policies. So, it will still be important to only use devices and services from companies you trust with your data. There has been a lot of confusion and questions about how Matter devices will work in our homes. With the release of Matter and the opening of the certification program, it looks like we will soon find out.

Menu Expand Entertainment Death Stranding is a long, bizarre journey that’s both breathtaking and boring Hideo Kojima’s post-Metal Gear game demands a lot from players By Andrew Webster Nov 1, 2019, 7:01 AM UTC | Share this story If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Part of / The best games of 2019 In Death Stranding , your character Sam carries a small baby in an orange bottle strapped to his chest. It stays with him at all times. The child, called a BB, is essentially a tool: it alerts Sam to ghostly apparitions called BTs, which dot the post-apocalyptic landscape he must traverse. The whole situation is unsettling. BB cries when it gets scared — whether it’s because of imminent danger or because you keep falling down a slippery mountain — and the haunting sound is piped through the speaker on the PS4 controller. This makes it even more unsettling. Over the course of the game, which lasts upwards of 50 hours, my feelings toward BB changed. At first, it was an uncomfortable nuisance, but eventually, I became attached to the kid. When it cried, I’d find a safe space to rock it until it calmed down, and I always made sure to check on it when we’d bunk for the night. During the few moments in the game when Sam and BB were separated, it felt like something important was missing. The relationship between Sam and BB mirrors my experience with Death Stranding , the latest epic game from enigmatic director Hideo Kojima, who is best known for his work on the Metal Gear Solid series. It’s not a game that makes itself easy to enjoy. There are few concessions for uninterested players. It’s ponderously slow, particularly in the early chapters, which largely consist of delivering packages over staggering distances. Early conversations are filled with phrases and words that will be incomprehensible to the uninitiated — and, honestly, much of it remains a mystery after the credits roll. But over time, that sense of bewilderment slipped away. Eventually, I found myself engrossed, digging deep into the game’s arcane lore to understand, as best I could, what was going on. It’s not easy to get to this point. Death Stranding is a game that seems to fight you every step of the way, whether it’s with clunky menus or nonsensical dialogue. It can be downright boring, but there’s also beauty and heart to discover if you can stick with it. Death Stranding takes place in a distant future, one that has been ravaged by a largely unexplained phenomenon called the death stranding. It wiped out cities and almost all life while opening a gate between the worlds of the living and dead. Those ghostly BTs haunt forests and mountains, and certain humans called repatriates are able to return to life from a strange underwater space known as the Seam. Sam, played by Norman Reedus, is one of these repatriates. He’s also something of a post-apocalyptic delivery man, shuttling supplies from one settlement to the next. Early in the game, he’s given a particularly ambitious task: reunite America (now known as the UCA, or United Cities of America) by traveling across the country, connecting settlements to a sort of internet-like network. At the same time, Sam is trying to reach the west coast of the country to rescue his sister who has been captured by a terrorist organization. It’s a lot to take in, and the game doesn’t do much to ease you into its world. Characters throw out terms like “DOOMs,” “chiral network,” and “stillmother” without explaining what they mean. For the first few hours, you will likely have no idea what’s going on. Luckily, the gameplay is much more straightforward than the storytelling. Initially, all you’re doing is walking. The company you work for, Bridges, will provide a package, and you have to deliver it on foot. Like most video game characters, Sam can carry an incredible amount of stuff; but unlike his contemporaries, Sam has to account for everything he carries. Before you set out on each mission, you have to carefully arrange your load — from healing items to precious cargo — so that Sam can stay balanced. The prototypical video game fetch quest stretched out to epic proportions The remnants of America look like a postcard from a particularly dreary day in Iceland. Much of your time is spent amid a steady drizzle and rocky terrain, punctuated by the occasional brutalist structure housing the remains of humanity. Your main adversary, at least in the early going, is gravity. With the uneven landscape and copious packages to deliver, Sam has to stay balanced in order to keep his precious cargo safe. You do this by adjusting straps on your back. The trigger buttons on the PS4 controller handle each side, so if Sam starts tipping to the left, you hit the left trigger and he tightens up his backpack to keep steady. Essentially, this means that while all you’re really doing is walking, you need to stay intently focused. One small slip, and your cargo can be ruined. At times, Death Stranding can feel like a big-budget remake of QWOP . Other times, it’s achingly beautiful as you stumble through a ruined landscape while ambient rock plays in the background. Gear is an important part of the experience. You’ll have access to ladders and ropes to help you traverse difficult terrain, and eventually, you can drive vehicles like trucks and motorcycles. It’s a slow burn, though; new upgrades come at a glacial pace, making each one feel significant and important. The first time you hop into the seat of a pickup truck, you’ll be overcome with joy. (Though that might be short-lived when your battery dies in the middle of nowhere.) There are also other obstacles, including terrorists who are obsessed ",Pass,0

One thing is definite—you didn’t have any knowledge of what your life would be like today. You had ideas, aspirations, and goals. Maybe you’ve achieved all of your wildest dreams, or perhaps you were derailed somewhere along the way. None of that really matters. What matters is that you went forward day-in and day-out—a little shaky and uncertain at first, but gradually more and more confidently. Each morning, we all have the freedom to choose how we will show up. How will you show up?

Trusted by the Pros See why makeup artists around the world are raving about us. Sara Law @saralawmua Pro Makeup Artist The product is very lovely. Glide on smoothly, very good working time, you can use a dome shape eyeliner brush to smudge it out to create a nice base for Smokey eyes or just made it softer; or if you use it directly, the color pay off is unreal. The pigment is true to color and it definitely delivers. It is long lasting and I dare say it is sweat proof. Nicolette Afable @nicolettemua Pro Makeup Artist I was so amazed at the staying power of the pencil eyeliner! I’ve tried it on myself and even products that claim to be waterproof tend to smudge on me at the end of the day, but not the Esqido Pencil Eyeliner. It stayed put for more than 12 hours! I’ve also tried it on my bridal clients and they’ve told me that they cried on their wedding day and there was no smudging or smearing at all! Joan Huang @aglowbyjoan Pro Makeup Artist Love the liners! They are long lasting, smooth and easy to use, I love how they don’t need to be sharpened and also the tip sharpener at the end! I highly recommend this to everyone, especially the girls with Asian eyes where most liners smudge on! Natalie Ventola @nattiventi Pro Makeup Artist The eyeliner glides on smooth! I thought the longevity was great! Even in the water line. I wish they were a tad more pigmented, but overall a fantastic product! Mark Jordy Gonzales @beautymmmark Pro Makeup Artist I love how the product is smudge proof once dried on to the skin. And also extra soft when applied which is important for a creamy pencil for the water line. Thousands of happy customers Over 250,000+ happy customers! Excellent Eye Liner My favorite eyeliner so far. Stays on the longest and is easy to apply. Christina A 06/01/2022 Smudge-free Eyeliner Gel pencil eyeliner I have only used the eyeliner a few times but absolutely love the results and it stays all day!  I am impressed.  I bought 3 and plan on giving to my daughter the other for Christmas in her stocking. kathy Guy 10/22/2021 Gel Pencil Eyeliner Pencil Eyeliner I absolutely love this product & have ordered it many times over.  If I could only have one item of makeup it would be this. I don’t just use it on as an eyeliner but to enhance my eyebrows too. Jehane Harrild 10/13/2021 ESQIDO Pencil Eyeliner The BEST! I’ve gone through a TON of eyeliners, trying to find one that would stay, not smear on my watery dry eyes. I saw an advertisement for this product on Facebook and had to try. Wasn’t really expecting anything, as they all claim that their eyeliners do the same thing.. BUT….. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised! This products works, doesn’t smear nor run and most importantly… does not wear off due to watery eyes! I love it and will definitely order again! Cathie 10/13/2021 Gel Pencil Eyeliner The best This eyeliner is the best I have used.   Against all the top liners I have used over many years, this is by far the best. Angela Johnson 09/13/2021 ESQIDO Pencil Eyeliner Eyeliner Easy to use and a great colour for my age and colouring. The main bonus for me is that it doesn’t affect my eyes as they are super sensitive to lots of liners and mascaras. Have bought many times now and will continue to do so, please do not stop making the my  colour or I would be devastated 😊 Jennette 09/11/2021 ESQIDO Pencil Eyeliner Best eyeliner I have ever had I have had lots ( and lots) of eyeliners and this is the best I have ever had, including very expensive ones. It stays in place, and doesn't leave smudges under the eyes. Washes off easily. Won't have any other! Maureen Smith 09/08/2021 ESQIDO Pencil Eyeliner Looooove this eyeliner!  It lasts all day! I was looking for an eyeliner that would not come off on the crease of my upper eyelid and this was it!  This liner lasts all day. I even fell asleep with it on one evening and it was still there in the morning.  I'm ordering more because I LOVE this eyeliner! LTD 08/24/2021 Gel Pencil Eyeliner Phenomenal First eyeliner I’ve ever used which actually DOES NOT smudge! I’ve tried many many eyeliners which claim they don’t smudge but this is the first one that actually lives up to the claim. Goes on smooth and stays in place all day long. Sheila Kibler 08/22/2021 Gel Pencil Eyeliner Nice Gel Pencil Eyeliner I am happy with my Gel Pencil Eyeliner from Esqido. The blue one makes my hazel colored eyes stand out more! Thank you. Kellie I Genovese 08/16/2021 Gel Pencil Eyeliner FANTABULOUS!! I absolutely love this liner. It doesn't smudge by the end of the day, and really stays put. Not to mention how smooth it goes on! Angel Landis 08/13/2021 Gel Pencil Eyeliner Stays on! Not smeary! Looks so natural! I bought gel eyeliner in brown and it’s exactly perfect.  I line just outer portion - up from last lash to bring eye up and then on outer portion of water mark under lash line.  Gives a natural beautiful look. I then blend with brown eyeshadow and create a mini natural cat eye. Buy this! Shelby 08/12/2021 Gel Pencil Eyeliner Eye Liner Love these eye liners. The black stays in place all day but the Blue and the Brown only a couple of hours so having to keep reapplying. Still a 5 star product best one on the market. Also fast delivery Julie 08/10/2021 ESQIDO Pencil Eyeliner Glides on and lasts Excellent staying power from a pencil with the feel of a gel. Love it. Megscoastallife 08/02/2021 ESQIDO Pencil Eyeliner FAVORITE EYELINER Goes on easy and doesn't tug on eyes. Great pigment. Lasts most of the day. My eyes tend to be on the watery side and I'll touch it up around 3:00 but otherwise, the brown (and now the navy) are my only go-to eyeliners.

THE DECIBULLZ EASY SHAPE SYSTEM ™ HEAT Simply heat the earpieces in warm water for 3-5 minutes. The earpieces will soften for easy moldability. SHAPE Place the now pliable earpiece into your ear and form them with the flat of your finger for a snug, secure fit. REMOLDABLE Decibullz earpieces can be re-warmed and molded to the shape of your ears until you find the perfect fit. EARPLUGS TO PROTECT YOUR HEARING I was thrilled with how the overall level felt comfortable. Quickly removing them, I knew that the club would have been too loud for me and off-limits without adequate protection. DECIBULLZ PERCUSSIVE FILTERS Customizable ear plugs that’ll deafen sudden sound bursts (like gunshots)—no batteries required. If the fit isn't quite right just start over again. GREAT CUSTOM GEAR If you’ve ever fit a mouthguard, you can fit Decibullz. Soften them in boiling water, press into your ears, and in minutes they harden to deliver a snug fit and clear sound. AMERICAN MADE DECIBULLZ EARPLUGS FIT PERFECTLY IN EVERY EAR Decibullz set out to create a custom fit, comfortable, set of in-ear plugs, and they succeeded greatly.

Free Strategy Session Unleash Your Team's Potential ""You're a purpose driven leader and believe in your team’s potential. You know you can achieve more and want the winning edge. That's where I come in. I specialize in supporting great leaders achieve breakthrough results."" Free Strategy Session Equipped Encouraged Empowered True leadership can be frustrating and lonely Do you struggle to strike the balance between team performance and morale? Overworked Are you working harder than ever to define strategy and coach your team? Overwhelmed Is your team stretched and trying to do more, with less? Over-Stressed Are you struggling to balance your work time and personal time? Free Strategy Session Hi, I am Mahan Here to support your leadership success L eading teams as a senior executive is not easy. The accelerating pace of change, the ever-greater demand for inspiring yet empathetic leadership all while needing to focus on organizational purpose and executing on a strategy to deliver measurable results can leave you feeling anxious, stressed, frustrated, and very much alone. But not to fret, there are proven approaches through executive coaching and leadership consulting to address these issues and more. As someone who has served as an operational leader in various senior roles and as a coach to senior executives from across industries, I understand first-hand what it is like to deal with these frustrations. With my support executives in the Washington DC region and globally have been able to: Become the kind of leader others want to follow. Set and execute breakthrough strategies. Nurture a healthy organizational culture that gets results. Implement Systems for Success such as OKRs. Align teams and improve team communication while improving team culture through partnering leadership! Ready to Partner? I am a believer in Purpose Driven Impact. The best teams have a clear, unifying, and inspiring purpose. Recognizing the importance of purpose is a critical first step. There are three additional key beliefs that my clients and I share in our partnership… GROWTH & REINVENTION With a rapidly changing world, there is a need for people and organizations to continue reinventing themselves. Finding new ways to disrupt the status quo is the only way to gain a competitive advantage - as individuals and organizations. The best leaders lean in and embrace change. PARTNERING LEADERSHIP The foundation of your relationship with your team is built on authenticity and trust. Partnering with your team is what pushes them to unlock their full potential, and gives them insight into how they can grow. People are looking for leaders that treat them as partners, working together to achieve a greater purpose.  That is partnering leadership. PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY The best leaders truly value their people and work hard to create psychological safety for their teams. This doesn’t mean accepting subpar performance or sloppy work; however, it does require a person-centered leadership perspective that encourages open communication, growth, and experimentation. Free Strategy Session I wholeheartedly recommend Mahan and seeking his counsel.  It will be one of the most valuable investments you can make in your organization’s future success. Peter Handal CEO and Chairman of the Board at J4P Associates, Former CEO SmartSource and Former CEO and Chairman of the Board at Dale Carnegie Training If you're committed to building a better company, then you need to work with Mahan. He's passionate about your success and will do whatever it takes to get you there. Triana Newton, Director of People and Culture at Harvest One There is no one better than Mahan in his field of human capital development! If you have an assignment in his multiple areas of expertise, I highly recommend that you use Mahan's outstanding expertise. Stuart TenHoor, President of TenHoor Legal Mahan’s counsel on strategy, operational execution, and organizational culture enables leaders to unleash the potential of their people and take their organizations to new heights in the face of the extreme disruption... Lyles Carr, Senior Vice President of The McCormick Group I attribute many of the skills I gained through the years to the coaching of Mahan Tavakoli. Since founding of my company, Mahan's coaching has helped us achieve unprecedented year over year growth for many years in a row.
