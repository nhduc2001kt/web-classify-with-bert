I get zeppoles once a year at the san gennnaro feast in NYC. If you ever wondered how to make donuts without yeast this may be the recipe you're looking for. These are the best doughnuts in my opinion and one of my favorite childhood foods. And this is the easiest donut recipe I have come across. This is my first dessert and of course, it's an Italian dessert. Be careful when you fry donuts at home.

All Rights Reserved Ethics Statement - The Verge The Verge The Verge logo. The Verge homepage The Verge homepage The Verge The Verge logo. / Tech / Reviews / Science / Entertainment / More Menu Expand The Verge The Verge logo. Menu Expand Skip to main content Ethics Statement Since it launched in 2011, The Verge has operated under a strict ethics policy that ensures our editorial independence and the integrity of our journalism. All of our editorial staff are required to abide by the following guidelines, many of which exceed standards in our industry. Earning and keeping the trust of our audience is, and always will be, at the core of The Verge ‚Äôs mission. In a world where information is distributed across countless platforms and formats, it‚Äôs more important than ever to promote clear ethical guidelines that allow audiences to know where that information comes from and whether it can be trusted. As a part of Vox Media, The Verge also adheres to the Vox Media Editorial Ethics & Guidelines . Editorial independence Our most valuable asset is the independence that allows us to publish stories without fear. The Verge is routinely critical of people and companies we cover, and we‚Äôre most proud of our work when we tell stories that people in power would prefer not see the light of day. We are able to enjoy this independence because every member of our editorial team is required to follow a strict code of conduct. Additionally, we enforce a strict wall between The Verge ‚Äôs editorial team and our parent company‚Äôs advertising teams (addressed more in detail below). Here are the core guidelines in our code of conduct: We don‚Äôt accept things of value from companies or from their PR firms, period We do not accept preconditions for coverage of a story that require us to say certain things We do not give subjects of our reporting the ability to preview or approve interview questions, nor do we allow them to review our stories before we publish We do not allow reporters to cover people or companies where they have a personal conflict We do not make paid endorsements of any kind We do not personally invest in companies we cover Our editorial team does not produce paid content, ever Our policy against receiving anything of value from companies we cover includes, but is not limited to, things like gifts, meals, discounted services, or paid trips and junkets. Vox Media and The Verge pay for all travel expenses to all events, including transportation, food, and hotels. Professional conduct In addition to standards that preserve our independence, The Verge ‚Äôs reporters are expected to abide by industry-standard ethical guidelines for reporting. This means that our editorial team takes great care to learn the truth and report it, protect sources , minimize risk of harm, and strive for accuracy and honesty in everything we publish. We use the Society of Professional Journalists‚Äô code of ethics as a baseline for the professional conduct of our editorial staff. Sourcing Standards at The Verge The Verge maintains high standards for sourcing. Our reporters will always carefully explain our sourcing practices to you and strive to protect your confidentiality when appropriate. If you are a communications professional, or talking to us in your official capacity, we will abide by the following definitions. ON THE RECORD ‚ÄúOn the record‚Äù is the default for talking to reporters and editors at The Verge. You say things, we record them, we can report who you are and quote what you said. We will expect corporate communications professionals and people speaking to us in an official capacity to be on the record in almost every single case, and you will have to tell us why you want to change this default every single time. ON BACKGROUND ‚ÄúOn background‚Äù means you can talk to us and we will not specifically identify you, instead using a descriptor like ‚Äúcompany spokesperson.‚Äù If you are a corporate communications professional speaking to us in your official capacity , we will not in any circumstances attribute you as ‚Äúa source familiar.‚Äù Going ‚Äúon background‚Äù is an agreement between you and the reporters or editors you speak to at The Verge . The general rules of an agreement apply: you may offer to go on background, and we will accept or deny your request. If we do not specifically accept, there is no agreement. This means: You cannot email Verge reporters statements prefaced with ‚ÄúOn background‚Äù and assume we will treat the material as if it is on background. You cannot tell us how a statement is to be attributed without asking. You cannot say things like ‚Äúbackground not for attribution,‚Äù and we will not agree to that terminology. This is just off the record. Say what you mean. A reminder: you have to ask, and we have to agree. Every single time. OFF THE RECORD ‚ÄúOff the record‚Äù is simple: you talk to us, we agree not to use anything we hear in any of our reporting unless we can source it otherwise. Like background, off the record is an agreement. If we don‚Äôt agree, you are not off the record. We do not readily agree to off-the-record conversations with corporate communications professionals or people speaking in their official capacities without specific reasons. Advertising Vox Media employs a dedicated advertising team that is responsible for selling advertising space on our properties. Any feature on a Vox Media brand sponsored by a particular company or advertiser that is developed independently by the Vox Creative and Sales teams is clearly marked as ""Advertiser Content."" Advertisements do not necessarily reflect the views of Vox Media or our editorial teams. Vox Creative and Sales teams have their own set of guidelines and policies for developing content and do not infringe on the creative agency of editorial teams. Our editorial teams do not directly accept money or other consideration from individuals or entities as a condition or incentive to write a review or story, whether favorable or unfavorable. However, some of our editorial content is made possible through the support of sponsors. This content is clearly marked as content ""Presented"" by the applicable sponsor. Our sponsors may select which content they wish to support, however, we do not allow our Sales teams, Vox Creative, or our sponsors to control or interfere with the editorial integrity of our editorial teams and the content they create. Some of our content may contain marketing links, which means we will receive a commission for purchases made via those links. In our editorial content, these affiliate links appear automatically, and our editorial teams are not influenced by our affiliate partnerships. Vox Media does employ a commerce team to optimize certain content for affiliate revenue, and such content is marked as such by including a similar affiliate links disclosure. We work with several providers (currently Skimlinks and Rakuten Marketing) to manage our affiliate relationships. You can find out more about their services by visiting their sites. Distributed platforms The Verge is a multimedia brand that is distributed across many platforms, including our own site on the web, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and others. Our editorial standards apply to all of our platforms. Vox Creative does, on occasion, distribute sponsored editorial content and paid branded content through our distributed platforms. They are clearly labeled as ""Presented by"" (for editorial sponsorships) or ""Paid Content"" (for branded content) in the post and further labeled using platform-specific tools such as the Facebook handshake. Corrections and updates Despite making every effort to be accurate in our reporting, sometimes we get something wrong. If we discover a mistake in a story, our editors will promptly issue a correction that removes the inaccurate information and adds a notice of correction that explains the error. In some cases, like if an inaccuracy is contained in a video, we may have to remove the original piece of content and replace it with a version in which the error is omitted. Sometimes more information about a story we‚Äôve published becomes available that either continues the narrative or clarifies the original story, but it is not a correction. In these cases, we may add and / or change elements of the original story. These updates will be clearly noted at the bottom of the story, indicating the time of the change and a note describing what was changed. Additionally, we may remove content if we believe it infringes on the intellectual property rights of a third party, otherwise violates any third-party rights, or breaches any applicable law or regulation. These decisions are made in concert with Vox Media‚Äôs legal team. Reviews Advising our audience about the best way to spend their time and money is one of our most important responsibilities. Our reviews always contain the honest, independent assessments of our editorial team. Like everything else we publish, there are no paid-for reviews of any kind written by The Verge editorial team. Companies may loan products (like laptops and smartphones) to our editors for a limited period of time so we can evaluate them and determine whether to review them. Occasionally, we will keep a review unit for an extended period of time to fully evaluate it and its software updates over time. We may also agree to an ""embargo"" with a company or PR firm that allows us to evaluate their product prior to its release. Personal investing We do not invest in companies we cover, and employees are forbidden from trading or buying stock in companies we cover or companies in the general technology sector. Vox Media‚Äôs retirement savings programs may hold some of these restricted stocks, but these funds are not managed directly by employees. Additionally, our employees are forbidden from owning or trading in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Other employment Employees of The Verge may not be otherwise employed by or receive compensation from companies that they are likely to cover, nor are they permitted to have any advisory role (paid or unpaid) at those companies.

Menu Expand Entertainment / Gaming / Tech Hideo Kojima‚Äôs new Spotify podcast launches in September Hideo Kojima‚Äôs new Spotify podcast launches in September / And his best friend Geoff Keighley will be there, too! By Ash Parrish Aug 23, 2022, 8:47 PM UTC | Share this story Image: Spotify Have you ever wanted to know how in the hell a man like Hideo Kojima comes up with some of the outlandish stuff you see in his games? Well, you‚Äôre about to, as he‚Äôs coming soon to earholes near you. During Opening Night Live, otherwise known as Geoff Keighley‚Äôs European Adventure, the maestro of video game marketing announced that his friend, Hideo Kojima, would be making an appearance. And whenever Kojima deigns to show his face, the gaming world pauses with bated breath, waiting to see what bonkers-ass game that man has cooked up now. But unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on where in the Kojima fandom you fall), his newest announcement isn‚Äôt a new game or even a port of an old game but a podcast. Brain Structure , Kojima‚Äôs new podcast , launches exclusively on Spotify on September 8th. ‚ÄúIn this podcast, we take a deep dive into his brain and shed light on his creative process,‚Äù reads the description on Spotify. ‚ÄúI look forward to having a good time getting and sharing creative inspiration with listeners from all over the world,‚Äù Kojima said in the announcement on Spotify‚Äôs blog. Kojima also mentioned that the audio will be in Japanese and English and that bestie Geoff Keighley will also make an appearance. Back in 2019, the last time Opening Night Live was held in person, Kojima showed up to show off new information about the then-forthcoming Death Stranding . His reappearance at the 2022 show teased that we might get a first glimpse at his next in-development game. But no ‚Äî it‚Äôs a podcast, which isn‚Äôt bad, but good loving baby Jesus even the name, ‚ÄúBrain Structure,‚Äù oozes Kojima‚Äôs esoteric weirdness. And, as an exploration into Kojima‚Äôs mind, it‚Äôs bound to get even weirder. God love the man, truly. He sure does know how to make a moment. You can listen to the prologue now on Spotify, with new episodes launching weekly starting September 8th.

Some of our most important stories start with tips. We‚Äôre always looking for information about the companies and products that shape the way we live, insight into the government agencies responsible for public health and the environment, and other stories about the impact technology has on human beings. Evidence is key: firsthand experience or revealing documents will be more useful than a hunch. Have you encountered something that the public should know about? If so, we want to hear from you. How to tip The Verge Email Email is the easiest way to reach us. Send tips to the general Verge email here: tips@theverge.com Email addresses for specific reporters and editors are linked on this staff list .

Signal You can also send tips using the app Signal , which encrypts text messages and calls. Signal stores your number and the last time you accessed the app, but not whom you communicate with. Be sure not to use your work phone. You can download Signal here . You can tip The Verge via Signal here: +1-646-412-7005 Depending on what version of Signal you‚Äôre using, you may need to add The Verge‚Äôs number as a contact before beginning a conversation.

For anonymity, use a public mailbox, and don‚Äôt include a return address. Address: The Verge P.O.

Network operators may still be able to see that you have accessed the Tor Network, so you should avoid accessing SecureDrop from potentially hostile networks, such as your workplace‚Äôs.

Menu Expand Entertainment / Gaming / Tech Is this a teaser for Hideo Kojima‚Äôs next game? Is this a teaser for Hideo Kojima‚Äôs next game? / ‚ÄòWho am I?‚Äô By Jon Porter / @ JonPorty Sep 15, 2022, 12:23 PM UTC | Share this story ‚ÄúWho Am I?‚Äù Image: KojimaProductions.com Kojima Productions, the development studio led by Metal Gear Solid and Death Stranding director Hideo Kojima, has posted a cryptic teaser on its website that has fans speculating about what the company could be about to announce. The teaser , which data from the Wayback Machine suggests was posted this week, shows a dimly lit silhouette of a woman‚Äôs head with the words ‚Äúwho am I?‚Äù superimposed over it. Of course, Twitter has been quick to come up with some theories about who this could be. The most convincing is that it could be the actor Elle Fanning , perhaps best known for her role as Alice Dainard in Super 8 . But that‚Äôs just the first level of the fan theorizing. Taking things a step further is the fact that Fanning also appeared in a 2001 film called I Am Sam . And, of course, Death Stranding‚Äôs protagonist was Sam Porter Bridges. See? The dots basically connect themselves. It‚Äôs been three years since the release of Kojima‚Äôs last major title, Death Stranding , and expectations are high for what the director might be working on next. Death Stranding‚Äôs lead actor Norman Reedus let slip earlier this year that a sequel is currently in development . Kojima also made an appearance at an event in June to announce that his studio is partnering with Xbox on a ‚Äúcompletely new game,‚Äù which is presumably separate from the Death Stranding sequel. Kojima himself doesn‚Äôt appear to have linked to the teaser via his personal Twitter account , which is free of any hints about what the image could relate to. Instead, the director has been busy tweeting about a recent video call with Get Out and Nope director Jordan Peele . His studio‚Äôs official Twitter account also recently put out a statement noting that it will not be showing off any new games at this year‚Äôs Tokyo Games Show, which runs from today to September 18th. (Instead, it plans to exhibit a VR experience based on the studio‚Äôs famous entryway .) Of course, there‚Äôs always the far less interesting possibility that the teaser relates to Kojima‚Äôs Spotify podcast , whose first episode was released on September 8th. The Hideo Kojima presents Brain Structure podcast promises to ‚Äútake a deep dive into [Kojima‚Äôs] brain and shed light on his creative process.‚Äù A second episode is due to release today.

Menu Expand Skip to main content The Verge Community Guidelines Welcome to The Verge ! The Verge is all about exploring our dazzling, terrifying, exciting future together. We‚Äôre so glad you‚Äôre here and hope you‚Äôll join our community of smart, talented, and enthusiastic people. We‚Äôve created these community guidelines to help make sure that everyone feels welcome to participate on The Verge .¬† Whether participating in comments on our site, or out in the wild, like on YouTube, Facebook, or Instagram, we expect everyone in our community to follow these rules. First, let‚Äôs talk about what makes great comments. Be respectful. Being respectful in the commenting community is about more than just following the rules or being polite; it‚Äôs about trying to encourage good conversation by welcoming and including others. Think about how your words and actions might affect others. Better yet: think about how you can help make everyone want to jump in. Be curious. The Verge is about exploring our future together. Show up to the comments with the same spirit of curiosity we bring to writing posts for the site; it‚Äôs fun to learn, and we can help each other learn new and interesting things together. Remember that people come from all different places and backgrounds, so don‚Äôt assume you know what they think, feel, or mean. Be interesting. Another way of putting it: be relevant . Try to bring something new or unique to the conversation. This isn‚Äôt a race to be the first, the loudest, or the edgiest. We hope you‚Äôll share cool stuff with the community, especially if that means sharing an insight that only you can provide. And remember to stay on topic; comments are not a free-for-all, and you‚Äôre more likely to write a great comment if it‚Äôs related to the topic at hand. Try to add value to each thread you participate in instead of just replying for the sake of it. Show your work. Approach commenting the same way The Verge approaches blogging. Making an argument? Back it up with something tangible that you can link to, whether it‚Äôs another news story, a scientific study, or a really good video explanation. Conversations and debates are usually richer and more interesting when people share the sources for their assumptions and conclusions. Help us out. Our moderators work hard every day to help make sure The Verge is a place where everyone feels welcome. You can help us by reporting comments that violate the rules, like spam, personal attacks, or creepy comments. (See the full rules below for an exhaustive list of Bad Things.) Put simply: don‚Äôt be a jerk to other people on The Verge. And if you see someone doing rude stuff in the comments, let us know. Rules We‚Äôre trying to foster great conversation and we will remove comments that hurt that goal. You‚Äôre free to say whatever you like at other places, but not here. At The Verge we have a different standard than the rest of the internet and we work hard to keep the conversation informative and fun. The bottom line is that the editors and moderators have the final say on whether comments fall within our community guidelines. We will remove anything we deem inappropriate, and these rules may evolve over time as needed. Doing any of the things listed here will result in your comment being removed, and serious violations will result in an instant ban. Personal attacks: Don‚Äôt attack or insult others. This includes calling other members trolls. Racism, sexism, and other discrimination: Attacking entire classes of people is just like attacking a single person: we‚Äôll ban you for it. Commenting on someone‚Äôs physical appearance, voice, or style: Let‚Äôs keep discussion to the content, please. Even if you‚Äôre writing what you consider a compliment, it will be removed. Trolling: ‚ÄùTrolling‚Äù is a big, messy term, but we know what trolls are and we won‚Äôt tolerate it. If you‚Äôre derailing conversations here at The Verge, we will take your comments and posts down, low-effort replies like ‚Äúslow news day‚Äù and ‚Äútl;dr,‚Äù especially. Spreading misinformation: We are not a platform for spreading conspiracy theories and misinformation, and will remove posts promoting obvious falsehoods. Doxxing: Don‚Äôt reveal someone else‚Äôs personal information. Illegal activities: Posting links to illegal downloads, ways to steal service, and other nefarious activity is not OK here. NSFW material: Nope, not allowed. Even images or links that could be considered borderline are not acceptable. A good rule of thumb is that anything beyond PG-13 will get you in trouble, but we reserve the right to remove any post we deem offensive. This goes for pornographic material, vile language, gore and generally gross stuff. Complaining about coverage: We cover a wide array of topics, not all of which are comfortable, unchallenging, or reflective of your personal views. This applies doubly to review scores. While we‚Äôre not against discussions of our coverage, plainly stated accusations of bias or drive-by comments about a writer‚Äôs expertise are usually an indication that you‚Äôre not trying to be a productive member of the community. Spam: If it comes from a human or a robot, spam will be deleted. This includes self-promotion. Generally speaking, promoting your projects here will be treated like any other spam. Above all, our team of moderators works to keep conversation here friendly, engaging, helpful, and productive. If we feel a comment or forum post is harming that endeavor, we‚Äôll take action.

When the idea of Matter was first floated in 2019 , there were a lot of people (myself included) who thought it would never happen. Apple, Google, Amazon, and Samsung sitting at a table together and coming up with a plan to fix the fractured smart home? Fierce competitors in the manufacturing space, such as lock makers Yale and Schlage and light makers Philips Hue and GE Lighting, developing a universal standard that would make their products work together in any ecosystem? It sounded like a pipe dream. And as the delays piled up , it sometimes felt like Matter would never arrive. The CSA has announced the official release of the Matter 1.0 specification. Image: CSA But today, Matter certification labs are up and running, the SDK is complete, and companies can start manufacturing, upgrading, and getting the official Matter stamp of approval for their devices. While the specification has only just been finalized, several companies were working on Matter-compatible products as part of an early access program, which means we could start to see Matter devices any day now. ‚ÄúWe had a strong group of companies that participated in our testing process,‚Äù Michelle Mindala-Freeman of the CSA told The Verge . ‚ÄúThese will be among the first products to be branded and available as Matter.‚Äù The Matter launch event scheduled for November 3rd will likely have some of these early products on show. The invitation indicates there will be a demo area where companies can showcase their Matter-certified products. The CSA is hosting a Matter launch event in November. Image: CSA A universal connectivity standard, Matter is designed to make smart home devices simpler .  By giving your door lock and light bulb a way to talk directly to each other, either over Wi-Fi or a newer protocol called Thread , Matter should make the smart home faster and more responsive. It should also enable an easier setup process, with compatible devices automatically showing up on your smartphone to allow you to connect them. Plus, with a common language that‚Äôs local to your home and doesn‚Äôt rely on the cloud, your devices can be controlled by more than one smart home ecosystem or voice assistant . This isn‚Äôt a quick fix, however, as the initial Matter spec only covers a limited number of device categories . The CSA has said it is developing specifications for more devices ‚Äî including popular categories such as security cameras and robot vacuums. But at launch, the compatible devices will be limited to smart light bulbs and fixtures, smart plugs and switches, smart thermostats and other HVAC controls, smart shades, smart sensors, connected locks, and media devices including TVs. Google announced that all its Nest smart speakers and displays will be upgraded to be Matter controllers. Some, including the Nest Hub Max, Nest Hub (2nd gen), and its Nest Wifi routers will also be Thread border routers. Image: Google The first rollout also includes Matter controllers and bridges, which are devices such as the Google Nest Hub Max and Amazon Echo smart speaker that can act as both a conduit for devices to talk to each other and as an interface for you to control your devices using voice or a touchscreen interface. Smartphone apps such as the Google Home app and the Apple Home app will also be Matter controllers. Bridges can also be Matter certified to bring their connected products into the Matter ecosystem. For example, Signify, owner of Philips Hue, has said its smart lighting control bridge will be upgraded to Matter , allowing its lights to be controlled by any Matter controller without the lights being updated. Amazon‚Äôs fourth-gen Echo speaker will be a Thread border router, and the company has said most of its existing smart speakers and displays will be upgraded to Matter controllers. Image: Amazon The CSA also says Matter is designed to be secure using technology that ensures devices have to confirm who they are and where they are from before being allowed on the network. In terms of privacy, Matter operates entirely locally over IP, but it doesn't rely on an internet connection to run. However, it is designed to talk to the cloud easily. Those conversations are controlled by the ecosystem app or device app you use and, in turn, governed by their individual privacy policies. So, it will still be important to only use devices and services from companies you trust with your data. There has been a lot of confusion and questions about how Matter devices will work in our homes. With the release of Matter and the opening of the certification program, it looks like we will soon find out.

Menu Expand Entertainment Death Stranding is a long, bizarre journey that‚Äôs both breathtaking and boring Hideo Kojima‚Äôs post-Metal Gear game demands a lot from players By Andrew Webster Nov 1, 2019, 7:01 AM UTC | Share this story If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Part of / The best games of 2019 In Death Stranding , your character Sam carries a small baby in an orange bottle strapped to his chest. It stays with him at all times. The child, called a BB, is essentially a tool: it alerts Sam to ghostly apparitions called BTs, which dot the post-apocalyptic landscape he must traverse. The whole situation is unsettling. BB cries when it gets scared ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs because of imminent danger or because you keep falling down a slippery mountain ‚Äî and the haunting sound is piped through the speaker on the PS4 controller. This makes it even more unsettling. Over the course of the game, which lasts upwards of 50 hours, my feelings toward BB changed. At first, it was an uncomfortable nuisance, but eventually, I became attached to the kid. When it cried, I‚Äôd find a safe space to rock it until it calmed down, and I always made sure to check on it when we‚Äôd bunk for the night. During the few moments in the game when Sam and BB were separated, it felt like something important was missing. The relationship between Sam and BB mirrors my experience with Death Stranding , the latest epic game from enigmatic director Hideo Kojima, who is best known for his work on the Metal Gear Solid series. It‚Äôs not a game that makes itself easy to enjoy. There are few concessions for uninterested players. It‚Äôs ponderously slow, particularly in the early chapters, which largely consist of delivering packages over staggering distances. Early conversations are filled with phrases and words that will be incomprehensible to the uninitiated ‚Äî and, honestly, much of it remains a mystery after the credits roll. But over time, that sense of bewilderment slipped away. Eventually, I found myself engrossed, digging deep into the game‚Äôs arcane lore to understand, as best I could, what was going on. It‚Äôs not easy to get to this point. Death Stranding is a game that seems to fight you every step of the way, whether it‚Äôs with clunky menus or nonsensical dialogue. It can be downright boring, but there‚Äôs also beauty and heart to discover if you can stick with it. Death Stranding takes place in a distant future, one that has been ravaged by a largely unexplained phenomenon called the death stranding. It wiped out cities and almost all life while opening a gate between the worlds of the living and dead. Those ghostly BTs haunt forests and mountains, and certain humans called repatriates are able to return to life from a strange underwater space known as the Seam. Sam, played by Norman Reedus, is one of these repatriates. He‚Äôs also something of a post-apocalyptic delivery man, shuttling supplies from one settlement to the next. Early in the game, he‚Äôs given a particularly ambitious task: reunite America (now known as the UCA, or United Cities of America) by traveling across the country, connecting settlements to a sort of internet-like network. At the same time, Sam is trying to reach the west coast of the country to rescue his sister who has been captured by a terrorist organization. It‚Äôs a lot to take in, and the game doesn‚Äôt do much to ease you into its world. Characters throw out terms like ‚ÄúDOOMs,‚Äù ‚Äúchiral network,‚Äù and ‚Äústillmother‚Äù without explaining what they mean. For the first few hours, you will likely have no idea what‚Äôs going on. Luckily, the gameplay is much more straightforward than the storytelling. Initially, all you‚Äôre doing is walking. The company you work for, Bridges, will provide a package, and you have to deliver it on foot. Like most video game characters, Sam can carry an incredible amount of stuff; but unlike his contemporaries, Sam has to account for everything he carries. Before you set out on each mission, you have to carefully arrange your load ‚Äî from healing items to precious cargo ‚Äî so that Sam can stay balanced. The prototypical video game fetch quest stretched out to epic proportions The remnants of America look like a postcard from a particularly dreary day in Iceland. Much of your time is spent amid a steady drizzle and rocky terrain, punctuated by the occasional brutalist structure housing the remains of humanity. Your main adversary, at least in the early going, is gravity. With the uneven landscape and copious packages to deliver, Sam has to stay balanced in order to keep his precious cargo safe. You do this by adjusting straps on your back. The trigger buttons on the PS4 controller handle each side, so if Sam starts tipping to the left, you hit the left trigger and he tightens up his backpack to keep steady. Essentially, this means that while all you‚Äôre really doing is walking, you need to stay intently focused. One small slip, and your cargo can be ruined. At times, Death Stranding can feel like a big-budget remake of QWOP . Other times, it‚Äôs achingly beautiful as you stumble through a ruined landscape while ambient rock plays in the background. Gear is an important part of the experience. You‚Äôll have access to ladders and ropes to help you traverse difficult terrain, and eventually, you can drive vehicles like trucks and motorcycles. It‚Äôs a slow burn, though; new upgrades come at a glacial pace, making each one feel significant and important. The first time you hop into the seat of a pickup truck, you‚Äôll be overcome with joy. (Though that might be short-lived when your battery dies in the middle of nowhere.) There are also other obstacles, including terrorists who are obsessed "

LATEST VIDEOS A Healthier Movie Night Snack Platter You are trying to eat a little healthier after Christmas but still want something good to snack on in front of a movie this weekend, right? Swedish Christmas Breakfast with Pom & Flora In this episode we visit our friends Anna & Rasmus that run the popular Stockholm caf√©s Pom & Flora and prepare a Christmas inspired breakfast together. Foraging Mushrooms This is the second episode in our new mini series where we travel around Sweden, explore local ingredients and traditions and cook with friends. OUR NEW BOOK! Green Kitchen Quick + Slow This book captures the two different cooking situations we often find ourselves in throughout a week.
We‚Äôve got recipes for the little moments ‚Äì The QUICK. The easy before-work-breakfasts, the simple but special lunch you make for yourself, the weekday dinner when you don‚Äôt want to spend the whole day in the kitchen but still want to eat something delicious. An easy soba and tofu salad, a blitz-roasted tomato and harissa pasta served over yogurt, or a speedy lentil and feta bake. Quick, hands-off, low effort ‚Äì big flavor!
But we also cover the special moments ‚Äì The SLOW. When cooking becomes the best part of the day. When you put on your favorite music and focus on making homemade kimchi burgers, mandolin fennel thinly for a crunchy slaw, cook a 4 hour vegetable ragu, pick up that special cheese, or place potatoes in salt brine on Sunday because you want to serve fermented fries the next week. Food you cook when you have friends coming over or when you just want an excuse to have a joyful moment. 
We hope it can be a reminder to balance the quick and slow in the kitchen. And in life. A cookbook, but also a conversation about how food can be our best therapy, friend and the ultimate joy. You can read more about the book here .

https://www.megantheveganmom.com/,0,"M T V M M T V M Home (current) Define Alternatives More than a Diet Veganism Introduction Resource Pescaterian vs Vegetarian vs Vegan A vegetarian abstains from consuming any animal products like meat, poultry, or fish. Vegans are more stringent vegetarians who additionally abstain from eating dairy, eggs, and any other products with animal byproducts. All meat and poultry, including beef, hog, chicken, and turkey, are forbidden on pescatarian diets. Seafood and other animal items like dairy and eggs are still included. Discussing Dairy Alternatives With the scope of life, we can clearly say that we are not baby cows. Cows produce milk for the same reason that humans do, to feed their babies. A mother produces milk, and that milk was specifically designed for their baby, a human. However, within 1-3 days after birth, most dairy farms take calves from their moms. Why would they do such a horrible act? You can thus consume milk, cheese, and yogurt. Although the milk was meant for the calf's infant, it is currently being devoured by people. What transpires to the infant who was yanked from its mother now? Accordingly, female calves frequently suffer the same heinous destiny as their mothers. When they are old enough, they are bred or artificially sexed. After having their children taken away from them, they are used as milk machines until they are unable to produce milk any more, at which point they are killed. Male calves are abducted, stall-raised for veal while shackled. When a dairy cow's milk output starts to diminish, the dairy farms can no longer generate any money by keeping the animal alive. As a result, they die often between the ages of 5 and 6. A cow typically lives around 20 years. Did you know that only humans can consume the milk of another species? In fact, drinking human breast milk would be more natural for any adult who is still consuming milk. The idea of drinking cow lactate should make you queasy if that concept does. Only our species consumes the milk of other creatures. hy do we all consume milk from cows while we wouldn't consume milk from a horse, pig, racoon, or even our own lactating dog or cat? We continue to eat it even after we stop nursing from our moms. Never in a million years would I cross the street into my neighbor's pasture and milk his cows! You would? In my opinion, no. Dairy is bad news nutritionally everywhere you look. Whole milk has about half of its calories from fat and almost all of its carbs from sugar, all of which are in the form of lactose, which many individuals find difficult to digest. Even worse, the saturated fat in dairy products is just as high as that in beef. Additionally, dairy has no iron or fiber at all. In addition, you could wonder why the FDA won't say whether milk products contain pus if all of the above aren't enough to get you curious. I did say PUS. You are essentially sipping cow pus. Therefore, you should be aware that purchasing dairy products helps to prevent the slaughter of young calves for food if you oppose it. More than just a diet... Even though vegetarians and vegans may opt to forgo animal products for comparable reasons, for vegans, this decision frequently goes beyond nutrition. In fact, many people believe veganism to be a highly pro-animal rights way of life. Due of this, many vegans refrain from buying garments made of silk, wool, leather, or suede. Additionally, many vegans boycott businesses that do animal testing and exclusively buy cosmetics devoid of animal byproducts. As well as avoiding circuses, zoos, rodeos, horse races, and other events where animals are used for entertainment, those who identify as ""ethical vegans"" frequently avoid zoos. Finally, a vegan diet is popular among environmentalists due of its benefits in combating climate change and its lower impact on the planet's resources. Supporters of the Site ¬© ‚§¥"

Trusted by the Pros See why makeup artists around the world are raving about us. Sara Law @saralawmua Pro Makeup Artist The product is very lovely. Glide on smoothly, very good working time, you can use a dome shape eyeliner brush to smudge it out to create a nice base for Smokey eyes or just made it softer; or if you use it directly, the color pay off is unreal. The pigment is true to color and it definitely delivers. It is long lasting and I dare say it is sweat proof. Nicolette Afable @nicolettemua Pro Makeup Artist I was so amazed at the staying power of the pencil eyeliner! I‚Äôve tried it on myself and even products that claim to be waterproof tend to smudge on me at the end of the day, but not the Esqido Pencil Eyeliner. It stayed put for more than 12 hours! I‚Äôve also tried it on my bridal clients and they‚Äôve told me that they cried on their wedding day and there was no smudging or smearing at all! Joan Huang @aglowbyjoan Pro Makeup Artist Love the liners! They are long lasting, smooth and easy to use, I love how they don‚Äôt need to be sharpened and also the tip sharpener at the end! I highly recommend this to everyone, especially the girls with Asian eyes where most liners smudge on! Natalie Ventola @nattiventi Pro Makeup Artist The eyeliner glides on smooth! I thought the longevity was great! Even in the water line. I wish they were a tad more pigmented, but overall a fantastic product! Mark Jordy Gonzales @beautymmmark Pro Makeup Artist I love how the product is smudge proof once dried on to the skin. And also extra soft when applied which is important for a creamy pencil for the water line. Thousands of happy customers Over 250,000+ happy customers! Excellent Eye Liner My favorite eyeliner so far. Stays on the longest and is easy to apply. Christina A 06/01/2022 Smudge-free Eyeliner Gel pencil eyeliner I have only used the eyeliner a few times but absolutely love the results and it stays all day!  I am impressed.  I bought 3 and plan on giving to my daughter the other for Christmas in her stocking. kathy Guy 10/22/2021 Gel Pencil Eyeliner Pencil Eyeliner I absolutely love this product & have ordered it many times over.  If I could only have one item of makeup it would be this. I don‚Äôt just use it on as an eyeliner but to enhance my eyebrows too. Jehane Harrild 10/13/2021 ESQIDO Pencil Eyeliner The BEST! I‚Äôve gone through a TON of eyeliners, trying to find one that would stay, not smear on my watery dry eyes. I saw an advertisement for this product on Facebook and had to try. Wasn‚Äôt really expecting anything, as they all claim that their eyeliners do the same thing.. BUT‚Ä¶.. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised! This products works, doesn‚Äôt smear nor run and most importantly‚Ä¶ does not wear off due to watery eyes! I love it and will definitely order again! Cathie 10/13/2021 Gel Pencil Eyeliner The best This eyeliner is the best I have used.   Against all the top liners I have used over many years, this is by far the best. Angela Johnson 09/13/2021 ESQIDO Pencil Eyeliner Eyeliner Easy to use and a great colour for my age and colouring. The main bonus for me is that it doesn‚Äôt affect my eyes as they are super sensitive to lots of liners and mascaras. Have bought many times now and will continue to do so, please do not stop making the my  colour or I would be devastated üòä Jennette 09/11/2021 ESQIDO Pencil Eyeliner Best eyeliner I have ever had I have had lots ( and lots) of eyeliners and this is the best I have ever had, including very expensive ones. It stays in place, and doesn't leave smudges under the eyes. Washes off easily. Won't have any other! Maureen Smith 09/08/2021 ESQIDO Pencil Eyeliner Looooove this eyeliner!  It lasts all day! I was looking for an eyeliner that would not come off on the crease of my upper eyelid and this was it!  This liner lasts all day. I even fell asleep with it on one evening and it was still there in the morning.  I'm ordering more because I LOVE this eyeliner! LTD 08/24/2021 Gel Pencil Eyeliner Phenomenal First eyeliner I‚Äôve ever used which actually DOES NOT smudge! I‚Äôve tried many many eyeliners which claim they don‚Äôt smudge but this is the first one that actually lives up to the claim. Goes on smooth and stays in place all day long. Sheila Kibler 08/22/2021 Gel Pencil Eyeliner Nice Gel Pencil Eyeliner I am happy with my Gel Pencil Eyeliner from Esqido. The blue one makes my hazel colored eyes stand out more! Thank you. Kellie I Genovese 08/16/2021 Gel Pencil Eyeliner FANTABULOUS!! I absolutely love this liner. It doesn't smudge by the end of the day, and really stays put. Not to mention how smooth it goes on! Angel Landis 08/13/2021 Gel Pencil Eyeliner Stays on! Not smeary! Looks so natural! I bought gel eyeliner in brown and it‚Äôs exactly perfect.  I line just outer portion - up from last lash to bring eye up and then on outer portion of water mark under lash line.  Gives a natural beautiful look. I then blend with brown eyeshadow and create a mini natural cat eye. Buy this! Shelby 08/12/2021 Gel Pencil Eyeliner Eye Liner Love these eye liners. The black stays in place all day but the Blue and the Brown only a couple of hours so having to keep reapplying. Still a 5 star product best one on the market. Also fast delivery Julie 08/10/2021 ESQIDO Pencil Eyeliner Glides on and lasts Excellent staying power from a pencil with the feel of a gel. Love it. Megscoastallife 08/02/2021 ESQIDO Pencil Eyeliner FAVORITE EYELINER Goes on easy and doesn't tug on eyes. Great pigment. Lasts most of the day. My eyes tend to be on the watery side and I'll touch it up around 3:00 but otherwise, the brown (and now the navy) are my only go-to eyeliners. Sybil 07/27/2021 ESQIDO Pencil Eyeliner Get the smooth and precise look, all day long.

She was not only responsive but also accommodating and managed to roll out a large number of customized frames in a matter of a short few weeks, and the results were lovely!! My teammates absolutely loved it Shanru Lai SINGAPORE I am a big fan of The Letter J Supply. I have a number of Joanne's pieces and seeing them in various places at home always makes me happy! They project beauty, creativity, authenticity, freedom, faith, purpose and a lot more. I love Joanne's attention to details. Even her wrapping is thoughtfully done. I am sure it won't be long before I get my next piece! Laks Hett SINGAPORE One of a kind artistry. Exemplary attitude. Always with a smile. Lin Lim and Ng Tian It SINGAPORE I‚Äôve been a fan of Jo‚Äôs work from the moment I picked up her first series of black and white letterpresses postcards at Food for Thought many years back. When she ventured into calligraphy, it was a breath of fresh air. She has always endeavoured to co-create with God and that flow and spirit of excellence has really brought her from glory to glory. Having learnt under her at her workshops and also commissioned pieces with her, I have had nothing but doubled satisfaction and pleasure! In her teaching she has taught not only fine technique but also a positive spirit to bring to the nib and paper. In her works, her strokes have brought life, joy, comfort and relief to many spaces and occasions. There are many calligraphers out there, but none like Jo. Jasmin Lin SINGAPORE Jo is a talented and passionate artist. Truly love her every piece that speaks life to myself or when gifted to others. Natalie Ha Singapore I've been a big fan of Joanne's works ever since she started The Letter J Supply. When I moved into my own home, I've collected several of her pieces including some originals and I will rotate the display every now and then. My favourite piece is the Serenity Prayer piece which I commissioned from her a few years back. It now hangs proudly in my living room. I will definitely continue to support Joanne's work, now and in the future! Juliana Fan SINGAPORE With Joanne‚Äôs artwork being the star of my little corner, it has definitely become my favourite place to dwell in! ü•∞ One for me and my guests to draw inspiration from!
Joanne was attentive to my requests and was really helpful to update in every progress of the artwork‚Äôs customisation process.
Am a happy customer and will certainly be back again! June Chen SINGAPORE I attended Jo‚Äôs class with a bunch of girlfriends earlier this year. It was lighthearted, fun, and she was very encouraging. It‚Äôs great for people who are serious in wanting to pursue calligraphy and take it another notch because she‚Äôs very professional and skilled, but works for folks like me as well who has zero background and just want a fun session! Eunice Chan SINGAPORE A lovely modern calligraphy session with Joanne. She is patient, encouraging and most importantly, she is able to pinpoint the reason behind why I couldn't nail my writing and she offers  practical tips that work. I've been to another calligraphy workshop a few year's back and I feel Joanne is able to coach me better as she has a deep understanding of the craft. On top of that, I'm a left hander and calligraphy is extremely difficult for lefthanders as most materials and tools are designed for the right. Yet, through Joanne's teaching of the rationale behind the techniques, I'm able to find a way to write that suits left-handers. I'm definitely inspired to continue with the practice & I wish the calligraphy session was longer! Sheau Huei SINGAPORE I have followed Joanne's works on IG for awhile, and have always found her brush strokes to be very therapeutic for me. So when I moved into my new home, I approached Joanne to do a customised piece. And it turned out really great! Joanne is very approachable, and she was so patient with me who is a complete noob at such things. She is such a professional and so good at what she does, and at the same time very grounded and understanding. Will definitely get more of her pieces in future! Amy Huang SINGAPORE I had an existing artpiece at my dining table but felt the atmosphere seemed dull. I wanted to get a new piece of artwork that would liven up my space. I approached Joanne to commission her to do a piece for us. During the discussion she asked some insightful questions and it led to creating an artwork that encompasses our family values. We were so excited when the painting arrived. Once we changed out our existing painting with the new one, I could feel the mood of our dining space changed to one that was joyful and lively. Our whole family loved it!! Thank you very much Joanne!! Yue Li Tan SINGAPORE I try to learn Calligraphy via watching  various YouTube channels. However, after attended the modern calligraphy session with Joanne, it was amazing to note that my calligraphy writing has improved.
I am glad that I attended the session. Joanne shared many tips on tools and where to get calligraphy resources. Thank you Joanne for the calming as well as an encouraging session! Shirley Soh SINGAPORE I love Joanne works, they are unique and beautiful. She is creative and always come with new ideas for her artworks. All her artworks are great for own collection and as gifts for friends. I‚Äôve gotten some for friends housewarming and opening of new offices. The materials she used are also of very good quality. 
Highly Recommended! Raymond Tong SINGAPORE Loves Joanne's works. bought a couple of her lettering works for friends. Felt it makes a meaningful gift and her words always bring life and  joy. Genevieve Chia SINGAPORE Attended a Brush Calligraphy workshop at Wild Olive Branch conducted by Joanne on 22nd June. Joanne is such a professional. Her materials were very thoughtful and the pace of the lesson was good. The class was very relaxed and she was very encouraging. Joanne was also very knowledgeable at what she was teaching. I had a great time there and looking forward to attending her other workshops. Cindy Tan SINGAPORE Joanne‚Äôs brush lettering workshop is really good, especially for beginners. She goes into the granular details like how to hold a brush, how to care for your materials, and useful tips. The guides were simple to follow and the materials she gave were of great quality. She takes the effort to look at our practice sheets individually and give advice on how to further improve. The techniques I picked up from her built a really good foundation that helped me a lot! Miaoting Chia SINGAPORE Have engaged Joanne for school workshops and today's session was exceptionally SPECIAL! Our students were so engrossed and did their artwork on spreading awareness with so much PRIDE! Joanne was excellent in tailoring the sessions to meet the needs of our pupils! Looking forward to more sessions in the future!! Sheena Mi SINGAPORE I commissioned Jo to create something special for the cover of my Festive Guide. She did an amazing job! She is super accommodating, understanding and so patient. I would work with her again and again. Love her passion in her art. Sharon Carvalho SINGAPORE Had a wonderful day learning calligraphy  with friends from Joanne. It's not easy to write beautifully but Joanne makes it look so effortless. She's such an inspiration! Cheryl Goh SINGAPORE Had a super fun time learning brush lettering w Joanne today! She was really patient and systematic at teaching us - from basic strokes, to letters, to joining them, and then to blending colours!! I‚Äôm so glad she decided to embark on this journey to teach others what she‚Äôs passionate about.

This results in a perfect fit made just for you. ISOLATION Decibullz earplugs are rated for up to 31 NRR. That‚Äôs one of the highest levels of hearing protection on the market. SECURE Thanks to their ability to create a secure, snug fit, Decibullz earpieces will stay in place when you‚Äôre on the move. THE DECIBULLZ EASY SHAPE SYSTEM ‚Ñ¢ HEAT Simply heat the earpieces in warm water for 3-5 minutes. The earpieces will soften for easy moldability. SHAPE Place the now pliable earpiece into your ear and form them with the flat of your finger for a snug, secure fit. REMOLDABLE Decibullz earpieces can be re-warmed and molded to the shape of your ears until you find the perfect fit. EARPLUGS TO PROTECT YOUR HEARING I was thrilled with how the overall level felt comfortable. Quickly removing them, I knew that the club would have been too loud for me and off-limits without adequate protection. DECIBULLZ PERCUSSIVE FILTERS Customizable ear plugs that‚Äôll deafen sudden sound bursts (like gunshots)‚Äîno batteries required. If the fit isn't quite right just start over again. GREAT CUSTOM GEAR If you‚Äôve ever fit a mouthguard, you can fit Decibullz. Soften them in boiling water, press into your ears, and in minutes they harden to deliver a snug fit and clear sound. AMERICAN MADE DECIBULLZ EARPLUGS FIT PERFECTLY IN EVERY EAR Decibullz set out to create a custom fit, comfortable, set of in-ear plugs, and they succeeded greatly.

Place a sheet of paper on the floor against the wall and put your feet (with socks) on it, heels against the wall. Make sure you lean on your feet with full power when measuring. Now you simply draw a line at the end of the biggest foot. Measure the distance with a ruler and find the size that matches it: see size table. Are you in between sizes? In that case, we suggest taking the bigger size. Close material overlay Material guide 01_LEATHER All our leathers are tanned without the use of heavy metals and harsh chemicals. Whether it‚Äôs nappa, suede or nubuck, we use nothing but vegetable and synthetic dyeing extracts that are environmentally friendly.

What if I am not satisfied after trying them? Every pair of UE FITS comes with a perfect fit guarantee and a 30-day risk-free return policy. You have 30 days from the date you receive your earbuds to return them if you are not satisfied. Once the earbuds are shaped to my ears, can they be changed again? The short answer is no. Our patented technology uses light to mold the gel-filled earbud tips to the contours of your ear. Extra tips are available for purchase if you‚Äôre looking to share them with someone else. Can I control my phone/music directly from the earbuds? Yes! Using the companion app, you can assign functions to single and double taps that control volume, manage calls, engage voice assistants, and more. Can I use only one earbud at a time? Yes you can. Our earbuds are made to be used at the same time or independently. Wear one or both depending on your needs. What about sound quality? What kind of drivers are in these earbuds? The sound can be described as full, warm, and detailed with a deep, tight, and punchy bass. BONUS: Our companion app lets you customize your sound preferences using our sound equalizer. Do your earbud tips come in different sizes? Yes! Our one-size-fits-most tips (the ones that ship with your earbuds) fit the majority of people. If you have trouble with your fit after receiving and molding your earbuds, you can take our Fit Check in the UE FITS app to find out what size works best for you.

A hard truth It's time to face facts. For a long time, the healthcare industry has struggled to embrace the promise of digital. Most organizations are mired in tools and technologies that fall far short of a cohesive, integrated (let alone strategic) approach to the digital experience. And in healthcare, the challenges that stand in the way of becoming ‚Äúdigital first‚Äù are sometimes insurmountable, with increasingly tight revenue and the complexity inherent in building experiences that are truly connected to the patient-customer‚Äôs needs. In response to the coronavirus pandemic, many healthcare organizations dove into digital transformation, rushing to adapt to the new norm. Generally, they used one of two tactics: a rapid introduction of telemedicine solutions or a shift in focus toward truly thinking about the new digital patient. But now that the initial crisis-driven flurry of activity has subsided, most are left with a hastily constructed patchwork of solutions ‚Äì and no long-term strategy. In this exceedingly challenging environment, organizations that fail to maximize their digital health investments‚Äô impact will fall farther behind. Most importantly, the current moment has brought the industry to an inescapable conclusion: digital transformation is necessary ‚Äì crucial ‚Äì to healthcare‚Äôs future. The good news Despite these challenges, this moment carries with it a tremendous opportunity to revolutionize healthcare through a systemic approach to digital transformation. I lead healthcare organizations on this journey, guiding and working with internal teams to drive a new reality. For more than 10 years, I have been a passionate advocate of revolutionizing healthcare with coherent digital strategies, implemented using an approach that is both revolutionary and evolutionary. I‚Äôll work with you to identify what‚Äôs standing between you and a strong digital patient experience ‚Äì and deliver a customized solution that will maximize ROI.

Navigate UX is a results-driven UX consultancy for funded tech startups and enterprise, led by Adam Babajee-Pycroft, and supported by a network of trusted consultants. At Navigate UX we believe that visionary genius only gets businesses so far. What‚Äôs needed is a multi-disciplinary team of specialists bringing diverse (and separate skills) to tackle complex problems. Businesses need people to advocate commercial objectives and harness technology. They need empowered product managers, UX teams, and engineers who create value. Navigate UX can become a core part of any business to harness the superpower of correctly predicting user behaviour. You might be a funded startup looking to scale. You definitely will be an ambitious people focussed business. You have a vision. We will help you achieve that vision (visions make a great compass but a lousy GPS!). We work with people who recognise there might be a problem but are flexible about the solution. No design survives first contact with the user. It's your choice whether that happens early on in the process or after months of development. The formula for getting it right is prototype, test, iterate, repeat. We come in, ¬†we build a culture of continuous user research, we get you strong results, we make you look like a super hero, then you can fire us (if you want to!). Get in touch Ó†å I worked with Adam on an enterprise software project, a tough brief with complex requirements. Adam is passionate about everything digital and user experience (UX) which comes across in all of his work. He manages stakeholder groups extremely well and isn't afraid to challenge the client if he believes it is in their best interests. Chief Commercial Officer, VoCoVo Adam supported us through multiple rounds of UX research to help us better understand our online consumer journey. He listened to our objectives and used his expertise to guide us to refine these in order to create beneficial output. The resulting piece of insight has shaped our future thinking, has been used across the business and was delivered in a clear concise way. I would highly recommend working with Adam Omnichannel Digital Lead, Volvo Adam and his team undertook a key UX research project for Unite Students, under extremely tight deadlines. Not only did they work at pace and guarantee to deliver on schedule, the quality of the research and comprehension of our business were both exceptional. We are very pleased with the output and the detailed level of insight gained. UX and Design Manager, Unite Students ""We‚Äôve worked with Adam and his team for 6 months now and have been over the moon with both their design skills, creative ideas and responsiveness.

Leadership and talent: At Rio Tinto, ANZ and Hay Group, Anita has set the direction and scope for the leadership and talent agenda, thinking innovatively about solutions grounded in business context.

Over-Stressed Are you struggling to balance your work time and personal time? Free Strategy Session Hi, I am Mahan Here to support your leadership success L eading teams as a senior executive is not easy. The accelerating pace of change, the ever-greater demand for inspiring yet empathetic leadership all while needing to focus on organizational purpose and executing on a strategy to deliver measurable results can leave you feeling anxious, stressed, frustrated, and very much alone. But not to fret, there are proven approaches through executive coaching and leadership consulting to address these issues and more. As someone who has served as an operational leader in various senior roles and as a coach to senior executives from across industries, I understand first-hand what it is like to deal with these frustrations. With my support executives in the Washington DC region and globally have been able to: Become the kind of leader others want to follow. Set and execute breakthrough strategies. Nurture a healthy organizational culture that gets results. Implement Systems for Success such as OKRs. Align teams and improve team communication while improving team culture through partnering leadership! Ready to Partner? I am a believer in Purpose Driven Impact. The best teams have a clear, unifying, and inspiring purpose. Recognizing the importance of purpose is a critical first step. There are three additional key beliefs that my clients and I share in our partnership‚Ä¶ GROWTH & REINVENTION With a rapidly changing world, there is a need for people and organizations to continue reinventing themselves. Finding new ways to disrupt the status quo is the only way to gain a competitive advantage - as individuals and organizations. The best leaders lean in and embrace change. PARTNERING LEADERSHIP The foundation of your relationship with your team is built on authenticity and trust. Partnering with your team is what pushes them to unlock their full potential, and gives them insight into how they can grow. People are looking for leaders that treat them as partners, working together to achieve a greater purpose.  That is partnering leadership. PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY The best leaders truly value their people and work hard to create psychological safety for their teams. This doesn‚Äôt mean accepting subpar performance or sloppy work; however, it does require a person-centered leadership perspective that encourages open communication, growth, and experimentation.

As soon as they learn we do HR Strategy Consulting, every last one starts to complain about their employees. Turnover is high. Engagement is low. Too many are unproductive. Too many are unmotivated. Competitors are poaching our best people. Some quit before 6 months. A few have even ghosted us this year. All they want is to get paid more and get promoted. Nobody wants to pay their dues anymore. Teams don‚Äôt communicate well. Digital transformation is too expensive and too often ineffective. Just pricey software that nobody uses or buys into. We just need ‚Äúbodies in seats‚Äù to fuel our growth. Can you help me? OUR ‚ÄúWHY‚Äù To empower great companies to help their employees thrive consistently, so that they can do their life‚Äôs best work, creating a virtuous circle of premium brand, profit and impact. WHAT WE DO At Master The Talk Consulting, we take a unique ‚Äî and uniquely human - approach to HR Strategy and Organization Development. Instead of the usual resource- and systems-heavy approach by large consultancies that too often fails to engage employees, we first work to unlock and align individual executives and middle managers‚Äô personal Mission, Vision and Values to company mission, vision and values. HOW WE DO IT HR Strategy Transitioning from startup to corporation is often chaotic and fraught for getting the HR part right. We help with creating talent-team-company alignment on Mission, Vision Values, as well as Employee Handbook creation, Hiring and On-Boarding help, Career Pathway design and implementation, setting promotion and pay increase milestones, as such helping build the on-ramp to hiring a dedicated, full-time HR Director. Organizational Design There is no shortage of tech solutions out there to ostensibly improve communication, project management and productivity. Getting buy-in and adoption from employees is much harder. We focus on using proven, cutting-edge best practices, tools and strategies to dramatically improve and standardize information and decision-making flows and processes, performance bench-marking and organizational project management. Every part of our work is focused on creating and scaling a superlative Employee Experience, decreasing turnover and improving engagement, improving employee alignment, morale and productivity, leading to a virtuous cycle of happier employees, happier customers and higher revenues. Executive Coaching Just as importantly, we help C-suite execs to get the HUMAN part right in themselves ‚Äî and in their Human Resources. We work with them to create and grow their personal brand ‚Äî and the company‚Äôs ‚Äî by telling their story in a compelling way. With better alignment, they are now free to stop putting out fires and focus on solving problems strategically, empowering and trusting their employees. We coach them to automate, outsource and delegate tactical work, hire, coach, retain and develop top talent effectively, plus become effective leaders, not just managers. Client C-Suite executives feel more aligned in all areas of their life, get invited for speaking engagements, build a thought leadership brand and win industry awards, as well as start consulting and coaching side-hustles, leading to more business opportunities. Hands-On Implementation In addition to creating a detailed and robust Employee Handbook to standardize company culture, we also help with Hiring and On-Boarding, Career Pathway design and implementation, Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)/Team Playbook creation and Business Succession Planning. Given our wide experience in other functional areas of building successful startups, we are also happy                  to recommend trusted vendors for financial model creation and management, fractional CFO and CMO and other areas. let's chat to see how we can help your enterprise OUR WORK HAS BEEN FEATURED IN : ""Train people well enough so they can leave, treat them well enough so they don‚Äôt want to."" - Richard Branson what i do for clients: Teach your team a proven process and help them follow a clear roadmap and act quickly Share deep knowledge and experience in optimizing employee experience and personal development programs and trainings Save time with training that's proven and relentlessly focused on results Guarantee results and deliver clear -- and massive -- added value Give over compelling ideas that are fresh and actionable, coming from a great personal story with a uniquely different perspective Be flexible in delivering training online and in-person Remain available to continue supporting your team through coaching and periodic team Q&As get my 8-step guide for building a superior employee experience Training topics ‚Ä¢¬†Increasing Employee Engagement and Decreasing Turnover ‚Ä¢¬†Developing and Implementing a Winning HR/People/Culture Strategy ‚Ä¢¬†Winning the War for Millennial Talent ‚Ä¢¬†Future-proofing Your Company‚Äôs Workforce and HR Planning ‚Ä¢¬†Increasing Retention and Engagement for Millennials and Gen Z's with an Effective Benefits Strategy ‚Ä¢¬†Creating A Compelling Brand-Story Strategy ‚Ä¢¬†Leading Through Change In The Digital Economy ‚Ä¢¬†Training Your Gen X and Boomer Executives to Work Effectively with Millennials and Gen Zs ‚Ä¢¬†Delivering a Customer Experience that Delights Millennials Who should receive training?

We‚Äôre all fighting for the number one spot in our respective careers and businesses. To be at the top of the food chain, beating our chests as we tell the world that we‚Äôre the best. When we think of survival of the fittest, it makes sense at first glance. The weak get eaten while the strong survive. Yet, what happens when everyone starts doing chest bumps and yelling out that they‚Äôre the best? The harsh reality is that when everyone starts saying they‚Äôre #1, no one is. And that‚Äôs the reality of the world we‚Äôre in today. Now what if we don‚Äôt want to be a savage beast that claws down everyone to get to the top? What if we don‚Äôt want to play that game? Is it even possible for us to still succeed in a more eloquent way? The good news is that most of the people who have been beating their chests have been kicked out of leadership roles at large companies and people who are just like yourself are replacing them in executive roles. Think about that for a moment. Ethical leaders who never had a chance at the c-suite are now leading the largest organizations in the world. What if your brand could no longer be a juggling act, but an authentic extension of who you are? Where you could be your whole, true self and still take that top spot in your career or business? The world is tired of seeing polished personas who are touting that they‚Äôre the best. We‚Äôre tired of seeing companies without any differentiators, bragging about how great they are. Your customers, partners and investors are seeking deep connections with authentic and vulnerable leaders. Connections that you could provide through building a personal brand tailored around who you are.

Whether performing a background check on a prospective employee, vetting a contractor, or embarking on a new business relationship or venture, our customized support services and solutions give clients the advantage of verified facts, a crucial edge in today‚Äôs marketplace. ABOUT US Betancourt & Associates is comprised of highly trained and experienced professionals from law enforcement, the military, intelligence, corporate security, and the legal community. ¬† Consequently, we adhere to a stringent set of policies and procedures and utilize state-of-the-art encryption software that shield our clients‚Äô data, keeping it safe and strictly confidential. Our business is to provide our clients with solutions, not billable answers. We provide customized services to a diverse clientele including those in the food and beverage industry, transportation, property management, athletic associations, employment screening firms, human resources, law firms, private investigators, insurance companies, forensic accounting firms, angel investor groups, and the media. TAILORED SOLUTIONS The explosive growth of online data and informational database sources has given rise to an industry of questionable companies and internet-based sites offering claims of immediate search results and comprehensive reports. Unfortunately, there is no such ‚Äúmagic bullet‚Äù or single data source available to support these claims. Too often customers pay for useless one-sentence reports or meandering ones containing irrelevant and inaccurate information; what we refer to as providing information for information‚Äôs sake. Betancourt & Associates never accept information at face value or rely on indiscriminate database searches and sketchy third-party vendor sources. We procure information, trace it back to its origin, and then turn that vetted data into actionable intelligence. By working directly with our clients, we formulate meticulous individualized solutions for their informational needs and reject a one-size-fits-all approach. Our goal is to provide clients with precise intelligence solutions, not billable responses. Our successful business model in defined by trustworthiness, integrity, dedication, and a lifetime of hard work, not an algorithm or secret formula. In short, we take great pride in what we do and how we do it. Our Specialties DON‚ÄôT SETTLE FOR LESS Get Started Research Consulting Human Resource Support Services Risk Mitigation Litigation Support Documentation ÓÅ• We are drowning in information, while starving for wisdom. The world henceforth will be run by synthesizers, people able to put together the right information at the right time, think critically about it, and make important choices wisely. -E.O. Wilson OUR SERVICES Vetting At Betancourt & Associates, we specialize in verification; our thorough investigations encompass the examination of individuals and companies for both soundness and integrity, consequently providing invaluable insight to our clients in their decision-making processes. Background Investigations Our far-reaching background investigations enable verification of the information provided by a candidate or company. ¬†We dedicatedly seek and report the facts, without prejudice.¬† Whether reviewing job applications, screening prospective tenants, processing a structured settlement agreemen t, selecting volunteers, or choosing a child‚Äôs athletic coach, Betancourt & Associates‚Äô experience and expertise provides actionable results for all clients. Due Diligence Because conducting due diligence can vary widely based on need and purpose, our systematic approach focuses on the client‚Äôs objective and therefore consistently produces the desired results. The process itself ¬†involves conducting investigative research and analysis of a company, organization, or principal parties prior to entering into an agreement, financial transaction, investment, merger, acquisition, or partnership. Consumer Services As we can never be certain of another‚Äôs motivations, intentions, or character, vetting an individual in your personal life is just as important as vetting an individual in your workplace. Since we are predisposed to trusting others, our trustworthiness can make us a vulnerable target subject to deception and exploitation. When you‚Äôre contemplating meeting with someone you‚Äôve found on an online dating app, hiring a cleaning service, healthcare, child care, or home improvement contractor, our services will not only provide you with verified facts, but also assist you in navigating through the crossroads of honesty and integrity.

https://createyou.de/,2,"Mit Visionen erschaffen wir unsere Zukunft - Ulrike Ellinger Home Echte Bildung √úber mich Kontakt STARTSEITE mit Visionen erschaffen wir unsere Zukunft. ‚Äî Ulrike Ellinger MEINE VISION Raum und Zeit f√ºr echte Bildung Diese Seite gibt es, weil ich Co-Kreatoren fuÃàr meine Visionen und Projekte finden m√∂chte. Als Unternehmerin bin ich heute vor allem in den Bereichen Potenzialentwicklung und Schule aktiv. Meine Vision ist es, in unserer Gesellschaft mehr Raum und Zeit f√ºr die Entwicklung von Autonomiekompetenz zu schaffen. Zerstreuung und Ablenkung l√∂sen die Herausforderungen unserer Zeit nicht. Wir brauchen starke Pers√∂nlichkeiten, bewusste und aktive Menschen, die ihr Potenzial voll einbringen und so dem Leben aufrecht, mutig und hochmotiviert begegnen. Schule ist das zentrale Bildungsinstrument unserer Gesellschaft. Damit unsere Sch√ºler sp√§ter ihr Leben eigenst√§ndig und erfolgreich meistern k√∂nnen, ben√∂tigen wir in unserem Schulsystem dringend mehr Angebote zur F√∂rderung von Selbstorientierung und Selbstentwicklung, sowie f√ºr die Vermittlung einer zugewandten und gegenseitig unterst√ºtzenden Kommunikation. Statt in unseren Schulen also weiterhin haupts√§chlich theoretisches und praktisches Wissen zu vermittelt, sollten wir den Fokus endlich radikal auf eine bewusste Entwicklung des Lernenden selbst ausrichten. BUCH ANK√úNDIGUNG Zukunft Mensch Es wird zunehmend deutlicher, dass wir die beiden Schl√ºssel-Kompetenzen Selbstorientierung und Selbstentwicklung im Verlauf des 21. Jahrhunderts immer dringender brauchen werden. Unsere freie Lebensgestaltung ist gef√§hrdet, wenn wir uns weiterhin grenzenloser Zerstreuung und Ablenkung in der digitalen Welt hingeben. In meinem Buchprojekt Zukunft Mensch zeige ich auf, wie wir paradoxerweise gerade die aktuelle Schuldigitalisierung daf√ºr nutzen k√∂nnen, um mehr Autonomiekompetenz in unserer Gesellschaft zu integrieren, und so unsere kreative Power als aktive Weltgestalter zur√ºckgewinnen. Echte Bildung ANGEBOT CO-KREATION GEMEINSAM WELTGESTALTER SEIN Wir brauchen nicht nur mehr Menschen, die sehr bewusst und aktiv mit ihren Projekten zu Orientierung, Nachhaltigkeit und Frieden in unserer Welt beitragen, sondern noch viel wichtiger ist es, dass diese Menschen und Projekte sich miteinander vernetzen und aufeinander z√§hlen k√∂nnen, damit sich diese Aktivit√§ten exponenziell entwicklen. Denn wir haben l√§ngst nicht mehr unendlich Zeit f√ºr die Proleml√∂sungen auf unserem Planeten. Wenn Sie ebenfalls in den Bereichen Zukunftsgestaltung und Bewusstseinsbildung, Pers√∂nlichkeitsentwicklung und Potenzialentfaltung unterwegs sind, sollten wir uns kennenlernen und schauen, ob wir mit unseren Projekten gemeinsam st√§rker und effektiver sein k√∂nnen. Gerne bringe ich meine Kompetenzen als Unternehmerin und Coach ein. Meine St√§rke ist au√üerdem das strategische und multidimensionale Denken in komplexen Zusammenh√§ngen. R Sie wollen ebenfalls diese Welt aktiv gestalten? R Sie sind ebenfalls zielorientiert und vision√§r? R Sie arbeiten ebenfalls gerne schnell und effizient? R Sie √ºbernehmen ebenfalls gerne Verantwortung? Co-Kreation starten Zukunft Mensch EINE VISION√ÑRE GESCHICHTE zur Buch Website Kontakt Interesse an gemeinsamen Projekten? Schreiben Sie mir gerne!
