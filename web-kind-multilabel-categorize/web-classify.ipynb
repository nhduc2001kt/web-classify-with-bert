AWS stands for Amazon Web Services, which is a cloud platform owned by Amazon and hosted across its global data centers. AWS Certification is a credential that Amazon awards to you after passing an exam that validates your AWS Cloud knowledge, technical skills, and expertise. AWS provides the credential in a digital badge and title format so that you may use it on your business cards and other professional collateral to designate yourself as AWS Certified. AWS Certification is open to candidates over age 18 and those between the ages of 13-17 with their parent or legal guardian's consent. Candidates must be at least 13 years of age at the time of scheduling an exam. You can schedule an exam using either an online proctoring testing environment or at a testing center facility. Exams are offered by Pearson VUE and PSI, both of which are test delivery providers that deliver AWS certification exams globally. Are AWS Certifications difficult? Due to the complexity of the exam content and recommended experience to successfully pass exams and obtain certifications, people might consider AWS Certifications difficult. AWS recommends that candidates have a minimum of six months of experience with AWS to take the Foundational (first-level certification) exam. While exam difficulty depends on your experience and type of certification course, you can plan on spending 80-120 hours practicing and studying for your AWS exam. Some of the exams include scenario-based questions that can be challenging for certification candidates. Specialty exams include detailed technical information and are often considered the most difficult types of AWS Certification. To help prepare for exams, you can use AWS exam preparation resources (which includes AWS whitepapers) and watch Amazon’s complimentary AWS Certification exam preparation webinars. You can also leverage Udemy courses and practice exams and opt for AWS training services. How long does it take to become AWS Ceritified? The time it takes to become AWS certified depends on the type of certification, your experience, and the time you spend practicing and studying for the exam. If you follow the recommendations, certifications start with at least six months of experience. AWS recommends a minimum of six months of fundamental AWS Cloud and industry knowledge for the Foundational (first-level certification) exam. Its Associate certification requires a minimum of one year of experience solving problems and implementing solutions using the AWS Cloud. Its Professional certification states that it requires two years of comprehensive experience designing, operating, and troubleshooting solutions using the AWS Cloud. AWS does not list time requirements for Specialty certifications, but you can plan on spending 80-120 hours practicing and studying for each AWS exam. What are the different types of AWS Certifications? AWS offers four different types of AWS Certifications: Foundational, Professional, Associate, and Specialty. Foundational only includes the Cloud Practitioner exam, which requires six months of fundamental AWS Cloud and industry knowledge. Professional and Associate are role-based certifications that are for those in Architect, Developer, and Operations roles. Associate certifications require one year of experience solving problems and implementing solutions using the AWS Cloud. Associate certifications include Solutions Architect, SysOps Administrator, and Developer. Professional certifications require two years of comprehensive experience designing, operating, and troubleshooting solutions using the AWS Cloud. Professional certifications include Solutions Architect and DevOps Engineer. Specialty certifications focus on specific technical areas, and they include Advanced Networking, Security, Machine Learning, Alexa Skill Builder, Data Analytics, and Database certifications. Which language is required for AWS Certifications? AWS supports multiple popular programming languages like Java, JavaScript, C# and .net framework, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Programming language SDKs include Go and C++. You can use the SDK for Python to build applications on top of Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, Amazon DynamoDB, and more. You can use Ruby to deploy applications on AWS services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, DynamoDB, and more. You can integrate your PHP application with AWS services like Amazon S3, Amazon Glacier, and Amazon DynamoDB. There are no mandatory training or exam requirements to take an AWS Certification exam. Training is recommended as part of your certification preparation, but it is not mandatory for the completion of the certification. AWS Certification does not publish a list of all services and/or features that are covered in a certification exam. However, the exam guide for each exam does list the current topic areas and objectives covered in the exam. What jobs use AWS Certifications? Organizations using AWS span across multiple industries and business sizes, so those with AWS Certifications have plenty of career options to choose from. This includes startups, enterprises, the public sector, the military, and global banks. Global cloud-based products also present options in computing, storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile, developer tools, management tools, IoT, security, and enterprise application. Other jobs that use AWS workloads can be found in web and mobile applications, game development, data processing and warehousing, and storage and archive. You can also use your certification to join the AWS Partner Network (APN). The APN includes systems integrators and independent software vendors (ISVs). You can work for one of the thousands of systems integrators within this group who specialize in AWS services. You can also work as a part of the tens of thousands of ISVs that adapt their technology to work on AWS. What happens if you fail an AWS Certification exam? If you fail an AWS Certification exam, you forfeit exam registration fees. You will have to pay the full registration fee if you decide to retake the exam. While there is no limit on exam attempts, when you fail to pass an exam, you must wait 14 days before you are eligible to retake it. Beta exam test takers are eligible for one attempt only. Training is recommended as part of your certification preparation, but it is not mandatory for the completion of the certification. Therefore, if you need to retake an exam, you can use Udemy courses to study before retaking exams. You can plan on spending 80-120 hours practicing and studying for each AWS exam. Udemy offers a variety of AWS Certification courses. You can also use tools such as AWS exam preparation resources (which includes AWS whitepapers) and watch Amazon’s complimentary AWS Certification exam preparation webinars. What are some alternatives to AWS Certifications? One of the most popular alternatives to an AWS Certification is a Microsoft Azure certification path. Microsoft Azure offers 12 different exams, all grouped by a role-based structure like Fundamental, Associate, and Expert. Another option is the Google Cloud Platform, which is known for its multi-cloud deployment integration solutions. This one offers eight certifications, split between Associate and Professional categories. Lastly, SnowPro Certifications is also a viable choice to showcase your expertise in cloud computing. Available through Snowflake, a global cloud data platform company headquartered in Silicon Valley, SnowPro Certifications include the SnowPro Core Certification and SnowPro Advanced: Architect. Whatever you decide to get your certification in, you'll want to prepare for the exams. Udemy's courses are great study material to help you ace the test.

One key benefit of Illustrator is its scalability feature, which ensures whatever you create will fit your end-product specifications. This makes it ideal for presentations, websites, and print production. Another benefit of Illustrator is its tracking features, which allow you to maintain versions of your work in the cloud. Illustrator also works with productivity apps such as Slack and Microsoft Teams. What are some alternatives to Adobe Illustrator? There are both free and paid alternatives to Illustrator. Free options include Inkscape and Vectr. Inkscape is compatible with Windows and Apple systems, whereas Vectr is for web use only. Affinity Designer is another drawing tool available for Windows or Apple that offers both free and paid versions. Paid alternatives include CorelDraw, Macromedia Freehand, and Corel Painter. Mac users may also consider Sketch, another paid application that includes a design toolkit and collaboration features for team design. You may use other Adobe programs such as Photoshop and InDesign, both part of the Adobe Creative Cloud subscription, for graphics work, typography, and animation. However, neither provides the same scalability or line drawing features as Illustrator. Should I learn Photoshop or Illustrator? You may use either Photoshop or Illustrator for graphic design and drawing. Photoshop uses rastor files, which are ideal for photos and art that require minimal gradients. Illustrator uses vector files for less distortion when resizing graphics or incorporating distinct lines. It is generally better for logos, icons, and typography. Photoshop works well with photos and user interface (UI) creation. When making the decision about which tool to use, it is important to keep the intended delivery method in mind. Illustrator and Photoshop can render quality graphics for use on the Internet or in electronic media. However, Illustrator produces better print graphics and offers more options for resizing while still maintaining the overall image integrity. Read more about Photoshop vs Illustrator Can I use Adobe Illustrator on the iPad? As of October 2020, there is a version of Adobe Illustrator available for use on the iPad. The iPad version, Adobe Illustrator Draw, incorporates vector editing tools, brush, pen, shape-building, and type tools. The Apple Pencil stylus and touch screen features make it easy to draw free-hand from your mobile device. The cloud integration allows you to work on projects wherever you are and access your files from any supported desktop platform. The Illustrator application also includes camera features that allow you to take photos and immediately use them to create vector-based drawings. You can download the Adobe Illustrator Draw application from the App Store at no extra cost to Creative Cloud subscribers. How much does Adobe Illustrator cost? Adobe offers three subscription options. You can pay month-to-month and cancel at any time for $31.49 a month, make an annual commitment with monthly payments of $20.99, or prepay for the year at a reduced price of $239.88. Both versions of the annual plan require a commitment. Adobe does offer a free trial so you may explore Illustrator before deciding which subscription is best for you. The Creative Cloud subscription is available if you want to use Adobe’s other creative applications, such as Photoshop and InDesign. The Creative Cloud subscription costs $79.49 a month for the month-to-month plan, $52.99 for the annual plan (paid monthly), or $599.88 a year for the prepaid annual plan. Students and teachers may subscribe to the Creative Cloud at a discounted rate of $19.99 a month or $239.88 for the first year. Businesses may subscribe with extra applications such as Acrobat Pro for $79.99 a month. More details about pricing plans are available on Adobe’s website.

All courses have a 30-day money-back guarantee Learn more about Google Analytics Prepare for the Google Analytics certification exam with Google Analytics training on Udemy. This powerful suite of analytics tools helps businesses monitor a multitude of user activities, like visitor sales, traffic volume, and time spent on a page. A Google Analytics course on Udemy provides instruction on various Google Analytics uses, from reading analytic reports to interpreting results and much more. Frequently asked questions What is Google Analytics? Google Analytics allows users to collect, measure, and analyze website data. Used by more than 50 million websites, this powerful tool delivers a rich treasure trove for marketers to better understand the performance of their channels and websites to make data-driven recommendations. For example, it can share tons of insights into website traffic, how website users navigate and interact with a site, what pages they visit, and how they leave the site. Through Google Analytics, users can track every single page's activity on their website. All data gets aggregated based on four levels: by the user, by session, by page view, and by event (button clicks, ad views, etc.). It also tracks two categories of data—user acquisition (user data before visiting your site) and user behavior (user data while on your website). What careers use Google Analytics? Careers involving Google Analytics include business analytics managers who collect and study data that can help a business gain strategic insights into target markets, customer engagement trends, and website performance. A career in project management, particularly for software developers, can also benefit significantly from a background in Google Analytics. The analysis of data gathered from websites hosting online applications you develop alongside your dev team can get used to fine-tune the next iteration of an app. Careers in search engine optimization also benefit from Google Analytics expertise because you can use the platform to study how well a site is performing with its target market. Insights gained from Google Analytics can then drive adjustments to the site, helping it rank higher in search engines. What types of jobs hire people with experience in Google Analytics? People proficient with Google Analytics can qualify for any job that depends on the analysis of website traffic. For example, you can get hired to study how much traffic an online application is earning and how long people stay on the site before navigating either to another page or away from the company’s web property altogether. You can also get hired to study how well an advertising campaign is earning the engagement of a specific group. Google Analytics is valuable for evaluating the success of gated content as well. A company may hire someone proficient in Google Analytics to figure out how much traction a gated eBook, video, or infographic is getting with a group of people or segment of the market. Google Analytics professionals also get hired to assess the effectiveness of regional outreach campaigns because they can assess the success of efforts to reach people in certain cities or countries. What skills or experience should I have before learning Google Analytics? Before learning Google Analytics, you should be comfortable with performing internet searches using different browsers on computers and other devices. You should also understand how data analysis tools such as pie charts and graphs provide insights into data and trends over time. It would also be helpful to have a basic understanding of what search engines are looking for - particularly how keywords and geographical information can impact results. However, because the Google Analytics platform includes many explanations of key terms and concepts, you don’t need an extensive marketing or SEO analysis background to start learning. Virtually anybody who knows how to read a basic chart and use a computer is qualified to learn Google Analytics. What is the difference between Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager? Google Analytics tracks and stores data related to website activity, such as the number of people who visited your website in the last 30 days, the number of pages visited per session, or the number of visitors that bounced off of your website. It uses a single Javascript code snippet that gets placed on every page of your website. On the other hand, Google Tag Manager allows users to track how many people use specific features on your website or application, such as placing an order or completing a form. In this case, an additional tracking tag gets generated. Google Tag Manager allows users to deploy hundreds of tags on a single site, such as event codes, remarketing tags, and conversion scripts. From there, Google Tag Manager allows users to store and view all tag activity in one place. It is a welcome alternate to hard-coding tags on individual pages. Can I get certified in Google Analytics? Yes, one can become certified in Google Analytics. To pass the Google Analytics Individual Qualification (GAIQ) exam, users have to sign up to Google Partners and pass the exam with a passing score of 80 percent or higher. The exam itself is free to take and is 90 minutes long with 70 questions, broken up into several modules, each of which focuses on a specific practice area. If you have an exam coming up, you might want to brush up on your skills with a Udemy course.

All courses have a 30-day money-back guarantee Learn more about Social Media Marketing Social media marketing courses teach how to utilize search engine optimization (SEO) strategy with content curation to form a well executed social media plan. Social media marketing involves applying a process across multiple platforms to reach your target audience and drive traffic to your profile. No modern marketing strategy is complete without a solid social media marketing plan. Frequently asked questions What is social media marketing? Social media marketing uses social media platforms to build brand awareness, connect with customers, and drive users to a website or landing page. These platforms include Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, YouTube, Quora, TikTok, and Snapchat. Depending on the platform, content can include text, images, an infographic, a video, a poll, a link, or a podcast. A brand's target audience will gravitate toward some platforms more than others. For example, most Snapchat users are 15- to 25-years old, while Facebook Users span a much wider age range. Also, some products and services lend themselves to specific platforms. For example, Art, jewelry, and clothing work well on Instagram and Pinterest. Other platforms like YouTube can add a face, voice, and personality to a brand. Social media marketing includes several platforms, content styles, and strategies. Learn more about Social Media Marketing What platform is the best for social media marketing? The best social media platform for you depends on your target audience. It takes time and consistency to achieve results with social media marketing. So, many companies focus their efforts on a few key social platforms rather than spread their efforts too thin. The most important thing to consider when choosing a platform is who you want to reach because different platforms attract different customer groups. Facebook is the largest social media network, with over 1.25 billion users worldwide. Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest tend to have more female users, while YouTube, Snapchat, and Reddit tend toward more male users. Researchers find more users under 25 years old on Tumblr while Reddit's most massive audience is over 45 years old. How long does it take to learn social media marketing? It is possible to learn social media marketing in as little as three months, though six months is more common with full-time effort. Social media marketing uses several platforms, each with specific content requirements and success strategies. So, to create and implement an effective social media marketing campaign may require more research. A professional marketer will have to learn how to promote a brand, attract an audience, provide value, and implement targeted advertising campaigns on platforms like Facebook and Instagram. What skills are needed to become a social media marketer? Social media marketing includes a long list of skills. These can include writing, web page building, video production, SEO, and ad design and management, but many people specialize. Marketers develop strategies to attract, retain, and convert customers. To get started, experts recommend a focus of three to four services. One starter service bundle might be video storytelling, Google My Business listings, and SEO. An alternative focus for a new marketing professional could be social ads, retargeting, and landing page design. Or, community building, social media, and email marketing. Three or four services are enough to begin running campaigns for businesses, and there will be opportunities to add skills over time. Social media marketing is a broad field where individuals can develop their business according to their strengths and interests.

Much of our social and vocational lives play out on the internet, which prompts new industries aimed at creating, managing, and debugging the websites and applications that we increasingly rely on. View free Web Development courses Frequently asked questions What is web development? Web development is a broad description of the tasks and technologies that go into creating a website. It can be as simple as making a static text-based website or as elaborate as developing an interactive dynamic website. You can break web development into two different categories: frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side). Frontend code executes on the user's computer. This can include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Backend code runs on the server — this commonly includes communicating with a database and often involves languages like Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP. Web development does not necessarily include the design process — it focuses on code. A web designer builds wireframes to mockup their vision for a website and then shares that with a developer. The developer is responsible for writing the code that implements the design. What are the steps to becoming a web developer? Some web developers will obtain a degree or certification in the field. However, most jobs don't require a specific degree or level of education, just demonstrated knowledge of the field. So, it is more important that you know how to show off your skills. You could highlight your skills through relevant work experience or a portfolio of past projects. You might also share code you have developed using a platform like GitHub, or participate in solution-based forums like StackOverflow that reward you for helping others. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the first three coding languages you'll need to learn to break into web development. You need these three essential elements to create a modern website and work as a frontend web developer. HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) specifies the content of the website and builds the backbone. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the content. JavaScript controls the interactive elements of the website. Find out more about how to become a Web Developer How long does it take to become a web developer? The answer to this question will depend on you. The more time you spend developing your skills, the faster you can become a web developer. The good news is that web development generally uses light-weight code that is easier to learn than many other languages. If dedicated, you can learn the basics of web development in a couple of months. But good web developers never stop learning. A better question might be, \"What can I do to become a better web developer faster?\" The answer to this question is practice. Becoming familiar with coding helps tremendously, but there is also a less obvious benefit of practicing. The more you code, the more you will run into problems or find bugs in your code. A significant aspect of web development is solving problems and debugging code. The better you get at solving problems and tracking down bugs, the faster you will get at coding. Read more about becoming a Web Developer What are the most popular coding languages for web development? The must-know languages for frontend web development are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These languages are used by nearly every site you visit. JavaScript is a fundamental programming language for adding interactivity to your website. There are many popular JavaScript libraries that you can import and allow you to add useful functionality while dramatically decreasing the amount of code you might write, and offering features that would be difficult or time-consuming to code yourself. Once you are comfortable with JavaScript, you will want to explore the many libraries available. There are many other programming languages that you can use for web development. If you want to write backend code, you will need to learn a language that runs on the server that powers your website (as opposed to the web browser, where frontend code is executed). Consider learning Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP. It can be helpful to research which backend language is popular in the field that interests you most. What are the skills I need to become a web developer? You'll need to be able to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Mastering these three languages is essential for web development. They each serve a crucial function: HTML is the content itself – the words, pictures, etc., CSS controls how all of that content looks, and JavaScript makes a website interactive. Luckily, you can learn all three languages on your own using online tools and courses. To be a good web developer, you'll also need many skills beyond programming languages. A crucial professional skill is problem-solving. Good problem-solving skills will help you to track down bugs quickly and develop algorithms to complete complex tasks. Interpersonal skills are also necessary for the job, such as communication and collaboration. Many web development projects require a team of developers. To succeed in web development, you must work well in team environments. Learn more about Web Development skills What is the difference between front-end, back-end, and full-stack web development? Frontend web developers write client-side code. This is all the code that runs on the user's computer when they visit a website. Generally, this includes everything that the user can see. To write frontend code, you need to know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Backend web developers write server-side code. This is all the code that runs on the website's server. Backend code controls the logic of the website. For example, a frontend developer may code where a username will appear on a website and its style, but the backend developer will write the code that retrieves the username from the database. Backend developers need to know a server-side programming language in addition to HTML and JavaScript. Not all projects have a front and backend web developer. Some projects only have full-stack web developers, which do both front and backend coding. The team composition depends on the needs of the project. Full-stack web developers need to be strong front and backend coders. Read more about the differences What jobs can you get in web development? There is a plentiful variety of web development jobs than there has ever been. Webmaster is a traditional web development job that requires the applicant to know a little about everything, from managing content to adding new functionality to an existing website. Some web development jobs involved modifying the functionality of web platforms like WordPress, Drupal, or Magento. Others require you to create custom web applications using web development frameworks like Laravel, Flask, or React Native. A web developer can work on the front-end of a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, on the back-end of the application building the services apps use to retrieve the data they display, or on both parts of a web app as a full-stack developer. Web development technologies get used for traditional web development, enterprise app development, mobile development, and desktop development. Who is best suited to become a web developer? There are many types of people who will find web development the perfect job for them. Building web applications is all about solving problems, and it is a great career choice for people who like to explore creative new ways of coming up with solutions. Web development is also suitable for people who enjoy working independently, as you will spend a lot of your time alone with the code you write. A web developer should also be an efficient listener to translate the needs of a business into the website they need. Web development jobs are great for people who don't give up easily because sometimes troubleshooting bugs in code can be difficult. A web developer also needs to love learning. Web development technologies change fast, and web frameworks that have only been around a few years suddenly become a necessary skill, so you have to be willing to learn to stay current.

It can help you gain trust and maintain healthy relationships. Whether for personal reasons or to improve your communication at work, begin an emotional intelligence course led by experienced instructors on Udemy. information alert Not sure? All courses have a 30-day money-back guarantee Learn more about Emotional Intelligence Emotional intelligence is the ability to identify and properly respond to emotion in others, while also identifying and managing your own feelings. Emotional intelligence training can teach you how to actively listen, exercise empathy, and employ many other communication strategies. By using emotional intelligence, you can improve relationships at home and work. Udemy offers a range of courses to help you learn emotional intelligence skills. Frequently asked questions What is emotional intelligence (EQ)? Emotional intelligence (EQ) is the ability to perceive, control, and evaluate emotions. It relies on the ability to empathize and healthily respond to others’ feelings. Tests that measure EQ will assess how someone feels, rather than their aptitude for specific skills — which is the case for intelligent quotient (IQ) tests. You can break EQ down into four levels: perceiving emotions, reasoning using emotions, understanding emotions, and managing emotions. EQ is essential for good interpersonal communication, as emotionally intelligent people have good self-awareness and can tap into their own feelings relatively easily, making their relationships stronger. Working on one's emotional intelligence may improve quality relationships and relationship-building skills. EQ can be overlooked compared to IQ, but it is actually a good predictor for longevity in relationships and overall functioning in life. How does EQ differ from IQ? IQ refers to your ability to problem-solve, reason, and grasp or communicate complex ideas. EQ is the ability to recognize emotion in yourself and others and to use that self-awareness to guide your decisions and form strong interpersonal connections. IQ tests don’t evaluate emotional skills or creativity, whereas EQ does. A high EQ can indicate strong interpersonal skills, another type of intelligence. Often, we think “book smarts” signifies intelligence, and that is one form. However, EQ is another equally important type of intelligence derived from internally based factors. EQ stems from a strong sense of self, personal values, and an innate ability to have regard for others. What are the benefits of emotional intelligence? Some of the greatest innovators of the world are said to have strong emotional intelligence (EQ), but it's something that can be attainable for all. Many consider EQ a great trait to have because of how much it impacts our quality of life. Potential benefits include better communication skills to foster positive relationships and more empathy to reduce conflict. It also provides skills to overcome life's challenges, which in turn reduces stress and anxiety. Emotionally intelligent people might also have higher negotiation and people skills, which could take you further in your career than what's listed in your resume.

A must-learn for aspiring web developers or programmers, JavaScript can be used for features like image carousels, displaying countdowns and timers, and playing media on a webpage. With JavaScript online classes, you can learn to build interactive web applications, choose the best framework, and work with other programming languages like HTML and CSS. Frequently asked questions What is JavaScript? JavaScript is a curly-braced, dynamically typed, prototype-based, object-oriented programming language. It started as the programming language for the web and is one of the three layers of standard web technologies — the other two being HTML and CSS. JavaScript allows you to create and control content dynamically on a web page without requiring a page reload. Web browsers are able to interpret it, and when triggered by events, modify the HTML and CSS of a web page with dynamic updates. JavaScript also uses asynchronous calls to fetch data from web services in the background. Although it was initially only used in web browsers, JavaScript engines have since been put to use as servers with Node.js, included in desktop application frameworks like Electron, and embedded in phone frameworks like Apache Cordova. Learn more about Javascript Why is JavaScript important? JavaScript is the programming language that allows users to interact with the websites that they're visiting, making it a very important language for web developers to know. In the past, most developers focused on the backend; JavaScript was only relevant when they needed to use visual effects. As web development evolved and the focus shifted towards user experience, programmers started to rely on JavaScript for their frontend code heavily. Today, most sites use JavaScript to fetch and submit data, use logic, and generate HTML in browsers. JavaScript can also communicate asynchronously with data servers in the background without interrupting the user interaction in the foreground. These features make JavaScript not only an important language but a necessary language for modern web development. Read more about the importance of Javascript What are the main uses of JavaScript? JavaScript is a text-based programming language used for client- and server-side development. Web developers have used JavaScript since its inception to add simple interactivity to web pages like modals, animated elements, or image slideshows. While that is still one of its primary uses, Javascript has evolved to building complete web applications. SPAs, or single page applications, depend on JavaScript-based frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue to bring a desktop-like application experience to the browser. However, it's important to note that web browsers aren't places that make good use of the programming language. Javascript is also popular for building web services and back-end infrastructure with Node.js. React Native, Xamarin, Ionic, and NativeScript frameworks use JavaScript for developing phone apps as well. React vs. Angular vs. Vue: what is the best JavaScript framework? Choosing the best JavaScript framework for your web project depends on what you are looking for. React is a popular framework, which means you will find a lot of community support if you need help. It is also considered relatively easy to learn but is being developed at a rapid pace. Angular is a framework that makes data binding easy so that you can template an application faster. It also uses the RxJS library to simplify asynchronous programming and Typescript (which compiles to JavaScript) for a cleaner, less error-prone development process. Some cons of Angular are that it can have a steep learning curve and can be complex. Vue is a lightweight framework, so it is easy to learn, very performant, and flexible. Some cons of Vue are limited plugins, and its flexibility can lead to irregular code. Learn more about Javascript frameworks What is JSON and what is it used for? Because of the evolution of the JavaScript language, JavaScript has a variety of techniques for creating objects. But, ultimately in the background, JavaScript is using a syntax called JSON. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a standard text-based format used to represent objects in JavaScript. The same basic types of data represented in Javascript can also be represented in JSON, including strings, numbers, arrays, booleans, and JavaScript objects. Although JSON is based on the JavaScript object, it is not just used in JavaScript. It is also used as a format to transfer data from a web browser to a server and vice versa because of the format's simplicity and small size. The JSON format is used in REST APIs for this purpose and has replaced XML as the standard format for many APIs. Because of this, just about any language you use will have a method of converting data into JSON to interact with REST APIs. What is AJAX and what is it used for? AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is a technology that developers use to create better, faster and more interactive web applications. AJAX uses XHTML for content, CSS to style the page, and JavaScript for controlling content dynamically. AJAX allows you to update a web page without reloading the page (this technique is called a “SPA” or Single Page Application), request data for the page after it has loaded, receive data after the page has loaded, and send data to the server in the background. Despite XML being part of the acronym that makes up AJAX, AJAX can send and receive data in any format, including JSON or plain text. While traditional web applications use synchronous methods to send and receive information from a web server, AJAX can use asynchronous API calls in the background without blocking activity in the browser. AJAX is a data-driven rather than a page-driven technology. How can I teach myself Javascript? One of the best ways to learn to write code is through an online course that teaches you how to write JavaScript with an instructor that will explain the code, what versions you should use, and why. Learning to develop a real-world application, with an instructor explaining in a step-by-step fashion, will teach you modern code techniques. What is the best IDE for Javascript? With all of the different JavaScript IDEs available, the best option depends on how you intend to use it, along with your personal preferences. Webstorm is a popular JavaScript IDE from JetBrains. It provides fast static code analysis, integrated testing, local history, code refactoring, and debugging. While the IDE requires a paid subscription, many developers swear by it because of its compatibility with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Those searching for a free option might prefer VS Code. This general-purpose, open-source IDE comes with IntelliSense, Git integration, and debugging features built-in. Many third-party extensions are available to add new language and programming features, making it one of the more flexible choices. Atom is another general-purpose IDE that is popular with JavaScript developers. It is also free, open-source, and has third-party extensions to add functionality.

If you want to work in app development, computer engineering, or video game programming, we've got C++ courses for you. Explore our top-rated and hands-on courses to learn from scratch or deepen your knowledge. Frequently asked questions What is C++? C++ is a high-level cross-platform general-purpose programming language. It was created at Bell Labs by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension to the C programming language. C++ employed the object-oriented programming concepts introduced in the 1960s with the Simula 1 and Simula 67 languages. Bjarne Stroustrup described the language as a general-purpose programming language with a bias towards systems programming that is a better C and supports data abstraction, object-oriented programming, and generic programming. C++ is a language for defining and using lightweight abstractions. It supports user-defined functions, and the source code is easy to read. C++ is portable, scalable, and compatible with C programs. It is object-oriented, includes memory management, and allows for low-level manipulation. Finally, C++ has a large community support, making it relatively easy to find resources. Learn more about C++ What can C++ be used for? C++ is widely used for building applications, games, animations, and web browsers, as well as accessing data in databases and developing tools like compilers and operating systems. Because C++ produces high-performance code, it is used in banking operations for trading and in airline flight control systems. Game developers like Blizzard choose C++ for its rich GUI libraries and low-level functions allowing developers to code at the hardware level. Although many languages can be useful for cybersecurity, C++ plays an especially important role. This is mainly because C++ is a powerful, low-level programming language that can access hardware and low-level IT infrastructure, such as RAM and system processes, which are often most vulnerable to hacking attacks. Some of the famous applications that used C++ in their development are Adobe Photoshop, Spotify, Google’s YouTube, Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird, and Microsoft Windows OS. Find out what else C++ can be used for Is C++ still useful to learn? Even though C++ is a 30-year-old programming language with a steep learning curve, it is still useful to learn. While more modern higher-level languages will allow you to build a project quicker and easier, there are some applications where the speed and efficiency you can get from C++ are in high demand. Many game developers, especially when developing 3D games, prefer to use C++ because of its performance. C++ code is also used extensively with embedded systems, where it may be the only language you can use for a lot of hardware. C++ is also important to learn because so many other programming languages use its syntax; even if you never write an application in C++, the knowledge is translatable to programming languages like Java, C#, JavaScript and PHP. Learn about the differences between C# and C++ What is Visual C++? While C++ is a full-fledged programming language, Visual C++ itself is not a language. Instead, it is a set of development tools and libraries provided by Microsoft that makes it easier to create Windows desktop applications, server applications, Universal Windows Platform (UWP) projects, and .NET applications with C++. Microsoft Visual C++ ships with Visual Studio, Microsoft’s integrated development environment (IDE). Visual C++ in Visual Studio consists of libraries and tools for easier development and features its own compiler. Using Visual C++ allows a developer to get started more quickly by supplying pre-elements like Windows desktop and UI elements that would otherwise take a lot of time to build from scratch. Visual C++ only works on Windows platforms, so it is widely used by Windows developers but does not work for cross-platform applications. What careers use C++? C++ is still a widely used language. That being said, while there are plenty of careers that require C++ development skills, many of them are specialized. A majority of compilers and operating systems are written in C++ code, making low-level development a career option for C++ developers. There are also many careers in game development for C++ developers, as the performance C++ provides is a necessity for high-performance 3D games. In fact, 3D is a realm where C++ shines; many jobs that deal with 3D graphics of any kind use C++ as a primary language. A variety of embedded systems use C or C++ code, so hardware development is a good career path for someone proficient in the C++ programming language. You will find a career in C++ wherever performance is a must. Take a look at some C++ interview questions Why should I use C++? Although it is an older programming language, there are still reasons you would choose it as the programming language for your next project. C++ is a statically typed, compiled language. This means its types are checked when the software is compiled, resulting in fewer bugs at run time from type errors. As a compiled language, the resulting code is customized to the platform it is built for, resulting in smaller, faster applications. For projects where you need a lot of performance, you should use C++. Game development is one place where C++ is frequently used to create realistic 3D animation. Low-level applications like operating systems and database software also use C++. If you work with embedded systems, you will most likely need C++ to interact with the hardware. Read more about C++ What is the difference between C++ and C? The C programming language debuted in 1969 and was the inspiration for many programming languages to come. One of those was C++, which launched ten years later. Besides age, the difference between the two is that C was designed for procedural programming, and C++ supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms. C does not support polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance, while C++ does. Since C does not support encapsulation, you can use it to manipulate data from code outside the procedure. C++ does support encapsulation, so it cannot manipulate data from outside an object unless that data has specifically been made public. C is a function-driven language, while C++ is an object-driven language. It also does not support namespaces or function and operator overloading, but C++ does. What is the best IDE for C++ The best IDE for C++ depends on what features you need for the type of programming you will do and your personal preferences. There are quite a few integrated development environments for C++ that are popular. Visual Studio Code is one of the most popular IDEs for C++ because it is cross-platform, open-source, free, and supported by Microsoft. It also supports other programming languages and has hundreds of community-contributed and official extensions that you can also install for free to add more features. CodeBlocks is another popular IDE specifically designed for high-performance C++ programming. It also is free to use and cross-platform. Eclipse is a popular general-purpose IDE that was originally exclusive to Java, but it also works well for C++ programming with the addition of extensions. It is also free, cross-platform, and open-source.

Frequently asked questions What is iOS development? iOS development refers to the process of making mobile applications for Apple hardware, including iPhones and iPads. Objective-C and Swift are the two programming languages that developers can use to build these apps. Apple has three requirements for iOS developers: using a Mac computer running the latest version of macOS, downloading Xcode, and having an active Apple Developer account. Because Apple standardizes iOS development, you're likely to rely on their native APIs and libraries as iOS software development kits (SDKs) as well. If you connect your app to cloud-based services using Apple APIs, you can also use the cloud for storage, database management, and app caching. When you are ready to test your app, you can only do so using an Apple iPhone mobile device. Once the app is complete, and all conditions are met, the final step is listing it in the App Store for iOS users to download. Learn more about iOS development Is iOS development a good career? Due to its popularity and market demand, iOS development can be a good career choice. There are hundreds of millions of Apple iPhone and iPad users worldwide, giving you plenty of opportunities to work in iOS app development in any location. One of the career benefits of being an iOS developer is that Apple’s operating systems are standardized for future updates, which means that you do not have to invest your time to update them. To find exciting new opportunities in the iOS development field, try searching for relevant job titles such as mobile software engineer, mobile app developer, mobile developer, or mobile architect. Senior iOS engineer, iOS mobile developer, iOS engineer, and Lead iOS developer will generate useful results as well. What skills do I need to be an iOS developer? First and foremost, iOS developers should know how to code in either Objective-C or Swift. If you're unfamiliar with both, you should take advantage of Udemy's introductory courses that will cover everything you need to know to build and distribute your mobile apps on the App Store. iOS developers will also benefit from understanding how to use and navigate Xcode, as its Apple's official integrated development environment (IDE). Beyond the technical aspects of coding, knowledge of user-friendly interfaces can help broaden your skillset. Is iOS development hard to learn? Fortunately, iOS development has a series of checks and balances that make it easy for you to learn. For instance, it only uses two languages – Objective-C and Swift. You can easily take a Udemy course to get a good grasp of one or both of these programming languages. If you are new to Swift, its clean syntax will make it easy for you to read and maintain. Additionally, you can readily access APIs and save time coding because you do not have to type semi-colons. You can also use SF Symbols, which are a set of over 2,400 configurable symbols for use in your app. This tool makes it easy to include navigation bars, toolbars, tab bars, context menus, and widgets on your app. What is Swift and why is it important for iOS development? Start Developing iOS Apps (Swift) is an open-source programming language used for macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, and more. Swift supports all Apple platforms and Linux. In addition to being a tool to create new apps on Apple platforms, you can also use it for modern server applications. Swift is important for iOS development for a few reasons. Firstly, it is one of only two programming languages available to create apps that run on iPhone and iPad (the other is Objective-C). Secondly, Apple refers to Swift as the official language of iOS. Thirdly and finally, Swift also contains several safety features that are useful for developers. These include optional binding, optional chaining, and nil coalescing. Swift 5, specifically, is key for iOS development because it is binary compatible with apps. This feature simplifies iOS app development and reduces the size of your app. What is the best IDE for iOS development? An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, for iOS development is a desktop software that provides all the tools you need to develop iPhone applications in one interface. By far, the most popular IDE for iOS development is Xcode. It features automatic code completion and full syntax highlighting for both Swift and Objective-C. It is also integrated with the Cocoa Touch frameworks, allowing you to split your code editor into multiple areas. Most developers consider Xcode to be the best IDE because Apple made it to develop code for Apple products. Another popular IDE for iOS development is AppCode—a smart IDE created by JetBrains for Mac OS X and iOS development. CodeRunner 2 is another IDE designed specifically for Mac and iOS development that also supports many other programming languages like Swift and Objective-C. What is Objective-C and why is it important for iOS development? Objective-C is object-oriented programming that Apple has used since the 1990s. It combined the features of two other popular programming languages: SmallTalk and C. When Apple purchased NexT, they also got this programming language. Apple embraced the language, made it the preferred language for Mac OS X development, and integrated it into their Xcode Integrated Development Environment. Most Mac desktop applications got written in Objective-C because of their close connection to the operating system. And when the iPhone first came out, Objective-C was the only language you could use to create mobile apps for it. Apple products have a long history with the Objective-C programming languages. That changed in 2014 when Apple offered Swift programming as an alternative language for building both Mac OS X and iOS apps. Although Swift quickly became the preferred language, you can still develop software for Apple products using Objective-C. What is the difference between Objective-C and Swift? Objective-C is a programming language that's been around for a while. The first version came out in the 1980s before it was one of the official Apple programming languages. It is a closed source language that will only run on Apple products. Swift is a relatively modern programming language that Apple first released in 2014. Swift was designed from the ground up to work well with Apple products. But, Apple also made Swift open source and cross-platform. You can run Swift on not only Mac OS X but also Microsoft Windows and Linux. While Objective-C was fast for its time, Swift runs up to 2.6 times faster than Objective-C. Objective-C has complicated syntax and rules and requires developers to manage memory. Swift added automatic memory management and a simpler syntax that allowed developers to write clean, concise code.

You’ll find these words in web content, social media ads and posts, marketing emails, newspapers, magazines, billboards, videos, radio, and TV. Want to write them? Train up on sales psychology, writing helpful expert copy, crafting compelling headlines, and so much more with a copywriting course. Frequently asked questions What is copywriting? Copywriting is both a skill and a field of work. Copywriters craft the messages featured in advertisements, email newsletters, social media posts, product descriptions, and other marketing materials. Copywriters learn to tailor their messages to an organization's target audience and use the brand's voice. Effective copywriting grabs the reader's attention and communicates the offer, why they want it, and how they can get it. Copywriting is essential because successful marketing prompts people to take action. A stand-out headline and a compelling call-to-action will bring in more sales than plainly written copy. This means each marketing dollar brings more results, and fewer are wasted. Copywriting is the art and science of sales and marketing writing. How do I know if learning copywriting is right for me? If you love writing, copywriting may be for you. As a copywriter, you’ll spend plenty of time writing, so it’s crucial for you to love what you’re doing. Copywriting consists of organizing words in the best way to sell products, services, etc., or to create brand awareness. To be able to succeed in copywriting, you should also love reading, learning, and researching. Learning and researching will allow you to discover more about your target audience or industry and craft meaningful copy that speaks to them. Finally, if you know how to harness a range of emotions and create content to appeal to your audience, copywriting may be for you. Talented copywriters know how to connect with people and understand their issues to create copy that speaks to possible solutions. What kind of people are best suited for careers in copywriting? People who love to write are well-suited for a career in copywriting. Empathetic people can shine in a career in copywriting. The best copywriters can truly understand their audience and their pain points and connect with their emotions to develop and write relatable content. People who love learning will thrive in this career. It’s impossible to know everything about everyone and every situation, so researching and learning about your audience is essential for a successful career in copywriting. Analyzing the research you’ll encounter is crucial; reading is one thing, but taking what you read and creating meaning to craft content is needed for copy that sells. Finally, people who are willing to improve their work is vital. You’ll receive plenty of feedback throughout your career on how to improve your writing; plus, testing is an essential part of the process, as it’ll help you understand the content that resonates with your audience. What are the common career paths for copywriters? Some employees and clients may hire people without a degree, others may prefer hires to have a degree in English, marketing, communications, or other relevant fields. However, some employees and clients may hire for experience over education. To get experience, many starting in copywriting may pick up freelance gigs (or internships if in school) to help them build a portfolio and get their foot in the door. Afterward, entry-level copywriters may move on to become junior copywriters. After producing quality work, a junior copywriter may be promoted to senior copywriter, which will allow them to take on more challenging work. If desired, senior copywriters can move on to management roles, such as copy or creative director, marketing director, or chief copy editor. Many copywriters decide on a career of freelancing. How do I become a copywriter with no experience? A good writer with no experience can become a copywriter. The first step is to study the craft and start a work portfolio. Writers begin their portfolio either by working for free or for an online content agency that accepts new writers. As a new writer, you might not know what you want to specialize in, but you should let your experience guide you as you get started. If someone has a background as a nurse, they may want to choose medical writing as one focus. Hobbies, passions, and work experience will help launch a copywriter's career and make writing projects more manageable. Many copywriting jobs require expert knowledge or research. Extensive research can slow down the writing process, so some prior experience in an area improves the writer's efficiency and results. New writers can also take advantage of online courses to hone their writing technique. What skills do you need to be a copywriter? Copywriting requires a strong command of the target language. Copywriters write concise messages that need to grab people's attention and propel them to action, so a love of language is a plus. An effective copywriter knows their subject and can explain it so that others understand. It requires research skills, willingness to learn, and industry expertise. A copywriter can start working without specific industry expertise, but most companies want to see a relevant work portfolio when they hire. Focusing on a specialty can make getting clients and jobs easier. Copywriters also need to be able to put themselves in the reader's shoes and imagine their perspective. Strong time management is also vital since meeting deadlines keeps clients happy. Are copywriters in demand? Copywriters are in high demand at almost every level of skill. Skilled copywriters have always been valuable to businesses and organizations. They build brand awareness, simplify complex ideas, and create an emotional appeal that drives people to action. As the world gets more digital, the demand for content and copywriters continues to grow. Small to enterprise-level businesses need website copy, blog posts, landing pages, online ads, social posts, and more. An experienced copywriter will command higher rates than a new one working on building a work portfolio, but the demand is high at every level. Some writing platforms cater to new writers, providing low-cost services to clients as new writers gain experience. What are the different types of copy? Organizations and businesses need many types of marketing and sales copy. They differ based on format, audience, purpose, style, and tone. For example, a company may need copy for physical advertising spaces like billboards or fundraising events. Print advertising in newspapers and magazines, direct mail, annual reports, and flyers also need professional copy. Copywriters compose radio, television ads, and YouTube explainer video scripts. Stores need copy for product descriptions and promotions. Online, there is a long list of places to spread your message. Online copy includes blogs, web pages, social media, white papers, technical writing, company bios, and promotional emails. Professional copy is used everywhere businesses sell or market their products or services.

That includes both general cloud-based cyber security systems and ones for specific vendors. The specific vendors include Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. The IT association ISACA offers several popular cyber security certifications. The other big trade organization with popular cyber security certificates is the Computing Technology Industry Association, or CompTIA. The Internet Systems Consortium is a professional organization specifically dedicated to cyber security that has its own popular certifications as well. Read about the best Cyber Security certifications What is IPv6 and why is it important to cyber security? IPv6 is Internet Protocol Version 6. Every device that connects to the internet uses its own IP address. For a long time, most of the internet has connected using IPv4, or Internet Protocol Version 4. When the internet started to run out of IP addresses computer system professionals began planning the move to IPv6. IPv6 offers a lot more addresses by using larger numbers. It also is important to cyber security, as IPv6 is more protected than IPv4. It uses IPsec to protect connections and prevent malware. It can handle cyber attacks and protect online privacy. IPv6 can run end-to-end encryption. It supports more secure name resolution, protecting users against naming-based attacks. In short, it enhances cyber security and is the newest version of Internet Protocol. What is the internet of things (IOT) and why is it important in cyber security? The Internet of Things, or IoT, is the notion of a wide range of items or things that connect to the internet. We connect to the internet on a daily basis through our computers, our phones, and other personal devices like tablets. As the internet continues to grow, more and more items or things connect to it. Speaker systems like Amazon Echo (better known as Alexa) and Google Home connect to the internet to control everyday tasks. All household and office objects, including smart TVs that connect to the internet, become a part of the IoT. Copy machines and even refrigerators and thermostats connect to the internet as well. As we connect all of these things to the internet, they become vulnerable to cyber security attacks. These items can be less secure than computers and phones, allowing hackers and cyber thieves entry points to access valuable information.

Whether you want to be a professional designer or just express yourself creatively, we’ve got the right course for you. Frequently asked questions Who is best suited for a career in graphic design? Artistic people can succeed in the field of graphic design. Graphic design uses visual elements to communicate a brand’s story, ideas, or messages, so being an efficient communicator is essential. Graphic design is also a marketing tool, so being empathetic is also vital. Graphic designers must understand how their target audience feels, what problems they’re facing, and what visual elements they can embrace. Relatedly, graphic designers should be adept at problem-solving. Not only should graphic designers be able to understand how to reach their target audience, but they must be able to understand how their design assets fit with a particular project’s end goal. Finally, graphic designers should be patient and open to change. Graphic designers receive plenty of feedback and opportunities for improvement, allowing them to become more successful. What are the important skills for a graphic designer to have? Graphic designers must have an endless supply of creativity to constantly develop new and exciting ideas to create innovative, engaging visual elements. Graphic designers should also be adept in storytelling and problem-solving to determine the needs of their target audience and create graphic assets that tell a story to get them to take a particular action. Branding is an essential skill for graphic designers to create visual elements specific to a brand. There are technical skills that can help a graphic designer thrive. Typography, for example, is one of those skills. If graphic designers understand how fonts are made and can pick the right fonts for a project, they can excel. Other essential technical skills graphic designers should have include coding, interactive media, and Adobe creative software (Illustrator, InDesign, and Photoshop). What do I need to be a graphic designer? Fortunately, it has become a lot more affordable to purchase all of the necessary equipment and software to become a graphic designer. First of all, make sure you have a decent laptop or desktop. I recommend at least 8GB of RAM to run the latest popular design software. You will need to have access to design software that consists of the following three things: a Photo Editing Application, a Vector Program, and a Layout Program. There is a monthly subscription from Adobe for the Adobe Creative Cloud that gives you access to everything you need. Many alternative design softwares are less expensive and sometimes even free. Outside of a good solid computer (desktop or laptop) and access to software, the only other thing you need is your passion for learning design theory foundations, giving you the ability to produce relevant, in-demand design projects. Find out more about how to become a Graphic Designer Can freelance graphic designers earn more? The short answer is yes. It depends on your experience and average client size, too. If you can book a full-time client load you can easily exceed the average salary for a junior graphic designer. That is because you have more flexibility in what you can charge and the services you can offer. Freelancing gives you a chance to get paid for being fast, excellent, and efficient. With salaried positions, that is not always the case. You can also have the option to charge fixed rates (as opposed to hourly wages) which gives you a chance to make more money in less time once you get a good workflow going. Freelancing can be very rewarding because of the limitless upward mobility when it comes to new money-making client opportunities. Find out more about Graphic Design careers What are some careers in graphic design? There are many roles available within the graphic design field, and they all differ in skills, experience, and interests. If you have little or no experience, you could start your career with either a graphic design internship or a junior graphic designer position. Once you have gained more experience in the profession, you can seek senior-level roles, such as senior graphic designer, senior manager of graphic design, art director, or creative director. Those who have specific graphic design skills and/or interests can apply for roles like photo editor, web designer, multimedia designer, publication designer, user experience (UX) designer, and user interface (UI) designer. Read about the best Graphic Design careers What does a graphic designer do? Graphic design is such a unique craft as it combines both the marketing side of business and the creativity of art. A graphic designer's main job is to effectively communicate to the viewer the company's goals, wishes, voice and narrative through the use of both print and digital projects. These projects can include logo design, letterhead, social media graphics, website graphics, posters, flyers, signage, menus, editorial content and more. Graphic designers are involved in the marketing process of a company and help to make marketing messages seem unified through the use of color, typography, photos and layout. Learn more about what Graphic Designers do How to write a graphic design cover letter? Cover letters for graphic designers can be very different than most standard job applications. Find ways to show off your design skills by creating a custom design letter and layout. Try to find ways to incorporate your style in your typography and color choices. I think most people think they have to have a resume with a standard one-paragraph letter but fight the urge to be normal. Pushing your creativity to the max to craft a letter that will catch an employer’s notice is essential. They have to sift through hundreds of letters, why not be a bit more bold and different? Make sure you focus on legibility and professionalism. Keep it clean, neat, and organized.

All courses have a 30-day money-back guarantee Learn more about Tableau Learn to extract and act upon important information from large data sets. Tableau is a powerful business data analytics software that helps you make sense of data, and show its impact on a business plan. With Tableau, you can turn numbers and other data into actionable information through graphs, reports, and visuals. A Tableau course on Udemy can teach you the many ways in which you can use this popular data analysis software. Frequently asked questions What is Tableau? Tableau is an analysis software that is useful for Business Intelligence. You can rapidly create visualizations (also known as “vizzes”) by dragging your data fields into shelves and panes. From there, you can develop dashboards and stories to bring your analyses to life. The free version, Tableau Public, has full analytical functionality, including uploading vizzes to the Internet. However, you cannot save your files on your local or network drives. Because your published files are available to everyone, the free version is not suitable for analyses that contain sensitive or personal data. To save your files locally, you need to subscribe to Tableau Creator. It includes a suite of Tableau Desktop, Tableau Prep Builder, and a license to either Tableau Server or Tableau Online, which allow collaboration in a secure environment. Learn more about Tableau What is Tableau used for? You can use Tableau to create analyses quickly. With just a few clicks, you can load your data and create your first visualization. You can then combine visualizations (“vizzes”) to create dashboards, and use vizzes and dashboards to create stories. There are around a dozen different types of vizzes you can create. If you have numerical data, you can create a standard bar, line, area, and pie charts. You can also use lines to connect categories or use markers such as squares and circles. With geographical data, such as street, city, and state data, or latitude and longitude details, you can create maps. If you have activities with start and end dates, you can create a special visualization called a Gantt Chart. Once you have created a viz there are additional features you can use. You can add filters so the end-user can narrow down what data they are using. You can animate your analysis using Pages and publish your analysis online to Tableau Public. Read more about what Tableau is used for What careers use Tableau? Tableau is very useful for Data Analysts as they need to be able to interpret data to create meaningful results. Data Analysts typically use tools such as Excel to create their analyses. However, they can save a lot of time by using Tableau’s drag-and-drop feature to create \"vizzes\". Tableau can be useful for any career that includes the words \"Business Intelligence,\" such as BI Analyst or BI Developer. In this type of role, you would use a variety of advanced tools. Knowing Tableau would increase the range of tools that you can use. Finally, several specialist careers include the word \"Tableau\", such as Tableau Developer or Tableau Consultant. These would require a high level of Tableau knowledge to quickly create advanced, interactive analyses that use complex functions such as Level of Detail Expressions and Table Calculations. Take a look at some Tableau interview questions Does Tableau require coding? You do not need any coding skills to create straightforward analyses. You can access most of the functionality using drag-and-drop techniques – for example, dragging fields to row and column shelves and adding filters and pages. You can also adjust properties by right-hand clicking on any field and using the context menu. However, if the analysis requires calculations not included in the data, then you will need to create fields using formulas. Formulas can be fairly simple – for example, if you want to subtract one field from another, you only need to use the minus sign. Basic Tableau formulas use Excel-like syntax, with formulas such as IF, LEFT and DATEADD. However, advanced formulas, such as FIXED and INCLUDE, use a completely different syntax, which is not as straightforward but very powerful. What is required to learn Tableau? As with other programs, such as Excel, it is possible to learn Tableau by yourself with time and dedication. Prior experience with similar analysis software is helpful. However, learning Tableau is much easier to do with some assistance because Tableau uses a unique environment. There are useful shortcuts, such as using the \"Show me\" button to quickly create an analysis. An online course can be a great way to learn Tableau. Start learning Tableau today What certifications can I get with Tableau? There are three different categories of certifications you can get with Tableau. They are for data analysts, server administrators, and Tableau partners. Concentrating on the data analyst certifications, there are three levels of Tableau Desktop certifications. Specialist is the introductory certification, while Associate and Professional are progressively more advanced. You need to pass the Associate level before taking the Professional certification. If you are new to Tableau, then you may wish to focus at first on the Specialist certification. Compared with the Associate certification, the Specialist certificate is a lot cheaper, does not include more advanced elements such as Level of Detail Expressions, and does not expire (the Associate certification expires in two years). Find out more about Tableau Certifications What are some alternatives to Tableau? An alternative to Tableau is Microsoft Excel which is probably already on your computer. It quickly creates graphs and is a program that you are probably already comfortable with. Unfortunately, the graphical options in Excel have not changed significantly in the last few versions. So, the charts are starting to look a bit outdated. If you want a similar program to Tableau, then you might want to investigate Power BI. It is Microsoft’s Business Intelligence program and, just like Tableau, allows you to load data, use formulas to create additional columns, create visualizations, and upload them to the web. In addition to Tableau, you can also manipulate the data within Power BI by (for example) combining different datasets from a folder on your computer — and you can update the analysis just by clicking the Refresh button. In Tableau, you need to use Tableau Prep for such additional functionality. Learn more about Power BI vs Tableau What's the difference between Power BI and Tableau? Both Power BI and Tableau are data visualization tools that can be used for similar tasks, but there are some differences. Tableau can handle massive amounts of data, while Power BI can only manage a more limited volume of data. Power BI users range from beginner to experienced, while Tableau users are mainly analysts and experts. There is an initial learning curve with Tableau, but it also has more advanced and user-friendly features, while Power BI is geared more towards beginners. Tableau can connect to many types of data sources and, while the data sources available to Power BI are updated monthly, they are more limited. The biggest difference between the two is that Power BI is best for a team that prefers ease of use and low cost, while Tableau works well for a team of data analysts who need advanced features and capabilities.

All courses have a 30-day money-back guarantee Learn more about Digital Marketing Frequently asked questions What is digital marketing? Digital marketing refers to all forms of marketing delivered through online channels such as social media platforms, email, websites, mobile apps, and search engines. Brands use digital marketing strategies to connect with their current and potential customers, promote their products and services, and build their public image online. The goals of digital marketing are to increase awareness of a brand, convert new customers, and build relationships with existing customers to encourage brand loyalty. To accomplish these goals, digital marketers leverage a wide variety of digital assets, such as images, videos, logos, icons, and written content (blog posts, e-books, guides, etc.) to communicate and interact with consumers online. Digital marketing encompasses both paid strategies, like digital advertising and social media advertising, and organic strategies like search engine optimization (SEO), content marketing, and email marketing. What skills do digital marketers need? Digital marketing requires an understanding of data, analytics, and technical website features, as well as creative skills in communication, strategy, and psychology. Depending on the size of the company and its marketing team, a digital marketer may handle just one subset or may manage a wide variety of digital channels and strategies. Digital marketers leverage technical skills to optimize aspects of websites, apps, and email communication to create a positive experience for users. On the creative side, skills in content creation, branding, and social psychology are important for building relationships with consumers. Regardless of whether you work on the technical or creative side, all marketers need to be able to gather, analyze, and find meaning in data. Do digital marketers need to know coding? Choosing a career in digital marketing doesn’t generally require knowledge of coding, although basic coding skills can be valuable for digital marketers who work in website development, SEO, and email marketing. In these areas, a marketer may need to know basic HTML to update a website page or edit an email design. Marketing technology (Martech) is a growing sector within digital marketing, where coding skills are especially useful and may be mandatory for some roles, e.g., marketing automation engineer. Additionally, marketers who work with data may learn SQL, which helps manage databases and manipulate data. For marketers who are primarily responsible for creative tasks (e.g., writing and designing content, social media strategy, and branding), coding skills are not necessary. What are the different types of digital marketing? As the popularity and diversity of online channels continues to grow, digital marketing has expanded into many subsets. The primary types of digital marketing are content marketing, search engine marketing (SEM), social media marketing, and digital advertising. Content marketing includes the creation and promotion of any digital branded content, such as blog posts, infographics, e-books, videos, and website content. Content marketers share content through channels like email, social media, and digital advertising. SEM includes search engine optimization (SEO) strategies to help a brand’s website and content appear in relevant search engine results. Social media marketing includes a brand’s presence on any social media platform. Social media marketers strategize images, posts, and interactions with consumers on social channels. Digital advertising can include paid social media tactics and other digital ad placements that help get a brand’s online content in front of more eyes. Is digital marketing a good career? Digital marketing is a great career path for anyone who enjoys communicating strategically, analyzing behavior and metrics, and continually learning on the job. Businesses are often seeking digital marketing skills in content creation, social media, analytics, and marketing automation and technology. This makes digital marketing skills sought-after and translatable to a variety of roles. Because digital marketing encompasses many elements, it can appeal to people across a wide range of skills and interests. Those with technical skills may enjoy search engine optimization (SEO), search engine marketing (SEM), website development, or paid social media marketing. Those with writing and creative skills may enjoy content creation, organic social media marketing, and digital branding. Those who like problem-solving and big picture business strategy may enjoy a career in digital marketing strategy or campaign management. What is a digital marketing strategy? Digital marketing represents an evolution of traditional marketing, taking the “4 P’s” of marketing (Product, Pricing, Promotion, Placement) and executing them online. A digital marketing strategy is exactly as the name suggests. It is a game plan for how online resources will drive customer traffic and achieve established marketing goals. The basic concepts and marketing goals remain the same, but the tools and resources get tailored for our modern world, where much of the sales cycle happens online. What is the difference between inbound marketing and digital marketing? Inbound marketing involves purposefully creating a situation where the customer seeks out the sale compared to the marketer aggressively approaching the potential customer. It is comparable to baiting a fishing rod so that fish are attracted to it instead of chasing the fish down. It may involve tools like SEO (search engine optimization) or targeted advertising to catch the target customers' attention and tailoring the marketing to meet their current, specific needs. Digital marketing may include inbound marketing strategies, but it references the marketing process adapted to a digital world relative to one form of targeted marketing intended to bring customers to the marketer. What are the benefits of digital marketing? Digital marketing is a natural progression of the marketing process to adapt to an online audience. As people and companies shop differently, those marketing to these stakeholders naturally must do so differently. The online world has created a new landscape for marketing that allows for connections to be made more on an individual level and at virtually any time or place. Shopping can now occur online through any number of devices; once a marketer has caught the attention of a potential customer, that customer can follow up almost immediately before the sale is lost. That helps to reduce valuable closing time exponentially. Digital marketing can also be cost-effective as messages can be tailored to specific demographics and adjusted in real-time. It also allows marketers to be wherever the customer is at any given time.
